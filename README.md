# El Troubadour

This is the full source code / project behind [El Troubadour](https://eltroubadour.com), my music website.

It's made using Hugo, which means it's a static website that I can generate and upload once in a while.

The actual website is inside `el-troubadour`, everything else is metadata or supportive documents for the project.

Nothing is hidden or changed for this public version. It's the actual website, as I build it and host it. You might even find as of yet unpublished stuff there.

It's also the very first one I made using this new Hugo system I just discovered, so it's quite inefficient and not an example of good practices. (One day ... one day ... I'll update all my websites to the same efficient Hugo code.)

I'm open sourcing all my websites in an effort towards an open world based on sharing and transparency. It's the least I can do.
