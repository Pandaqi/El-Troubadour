These are the official lyrics for the song "As the Banjo Plays". It's track #7, or the _bonus track_, from the album ["Don't Forget Me"](/albums/dont-forget-me).

## Verse 1
I remember now  
The day you bought your instruments  
I recall you finally  
Opening up  
Your heart

## Verse 2
If you can’t tell me  
I’ve no place in your mute life  
All your soothing  
Melodies still enjoyed  
In spite

## Chorus 1 
Saying he will sail  
Safe into the night

He will be there  
When you’re giving up on life

And he’ll come singing  
And he’ll come singing  
‘Till you sleep

## Verse 3
(And) as the banjo plays  
Our kids a million miles away  
Will they know  
That these pained words  
Would become your last  

## Chorus 2
Saying he will sing  
Late into the night  

He’ll say the words  
When you’re done and filled with hurt  

Oh he will change then  
He will transform like  
A songbird

## Bridge 
And as the banjo broke   
His songs stuttered and he choked  
He was never what you dreamt   
But you loved

## Chorus 3
Him with all  
Your heart he kept in tune  

He’ll clear the air  
From despair because he cares  

And he’ll keep asking  
Oh he’ll keep asking  
Until you say  
Alright

You can hold me tight
