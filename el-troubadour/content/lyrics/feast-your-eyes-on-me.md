These are the official lyrics for the song "Feast your Eyes on Me". It's track #5 from the album ["Feast your Eyes on Me"](/albums/feast-your-eyes-on-me). Also the last track and the title track of course! 

## Verse 1
I challenged customs,  
I challenged faith, long-held beliefs  
I swore at stars ‘till morning,  
but wounds always come back

I did the right thing,  
I trained myself to the abyss  
I crawled out of my hiding,  
a fact I’ll always regret

## Pre-Chorus 1
And I know

## Chorus 1
Someone must play the devil  
Someone must be their god  
When we’re all afraid to lose what we have not

## Post-Chorus 1
They’re crying out  
they’re crying out your name  
Feast your eyes on me  
Feast your eyes on me

## Verse 2
They never listened,  
but take my force they’ll listen now  
If facts and charts won’t serve them,  
I’ll take my last bow

The stage was set dear,  
to fail and fail yourself to stone  
To walk right into fool’s lies,  
to dream it never was you

## Pre-Chorus 2
Still I hunger

## Chorus 2
For someone to play the devil  
For someone to tell us off  
I’m just so afraid to lose the only thing I got

## Post-Chorus 2
They’re screaming death,  
the storm raging through their bellies _(“bel -lie -ie -ies”)_  
Your eyes on me,  
Feast your eyes on me

## Bridge 1
Feast your eyes on me    
Feast your eyes on me  
Feast your eyes on me  
Feast your eeyes on

Meeeee ___

## Bridge 2
And you watch me through the window pane  
As you feel the love go sour  
I’m locked with you in my sights again  
As my virtues come tumbling down  
This plane’s about to run aground  
Oh __

## Verse 3
I made them panic  
the panic’s real, the danger’s not  
The truth will remain hidden, 
one eeeeye a million views  

## Pre-Chorus 3
Pointing

## Chorus 3
At someone to face the devil  
At someone to face their god  
‘Cause they’re all afraid, to see what you have shown

## Post-Chorus 3
They’re calling  
murder, a massacre at least  
Your eyes on me  
Feast your eyes on me
