These are the official lyrics for the song "Out Of Arms". It's track #3 from the album ["Don't Forget Me"](/albums/dont-forget-me).

## Verse 1 
Sunny days were never quite so __ bright  
Snowy days were never such ex __ traordinary sights  
And my heart said: “Let us live, let us live”  
Don’t hide now, don’t put up your walls  
Don’t fasten your armor because

## Chorus 1
I like the way that it  
Hurts and it burns yet I cannot let go  
I like the fear you leave for being alone

I’d drink all your poison,  
Give keys to my guard  
Because I’m out of arms

## Verse 2
Early mornings never felt so __ right  
Late night talks were never such long __ lasting delights  
And your voice sang: “Let us live, let us live”  
Don’t lie down, don’t bury your head  
In the problems of tomorrow instead  

## Chorus 2
I like the way that it  
Stings and it brings me a heartache or two  
I like the time wasted being with you  
I’d jump from the mountains  
Naked into harm  
Because I’m out of arms  

## Transition
It’s not giving up  
If I choose to leave the door open

## Bridge (part A)
So say goodbye to classes and tables  
Hi to the mess that we made of  
Life, to every injury of   
Faith, believe me I’d hate 

## Bridge (part B)
To be endlessly safe here but lonely  
Guarding secrets that only  
Me  
And no one around  
Cares about, what do you care about?

## Chorus 3
That I like being  
Afraid and too late, if your arms keep me safe  
I’d love a teardrop if the answer you gave  
Was love and tender kisses  
A soft word and warmth  
Put me out of arms

Put me out of arms

## Verse 3 (modified; cut short)
Frankly dear I never felt this __ shine  
Got no fear and no regret I'm __ drawing no more lines  
And I'll scream now: “Let us live, let us live”  

Let us live, let us live  
Let us live __ 

## Outro
_Ad-lib singing over bridge melody until fade-out_
