These are the official lyrics for the song "A Thousand Places I Don't Know (Part 1)". It's track #4 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

## Verse 1 
Oh he __ is  
Falling away __

Told him not __ to  
Run but to stay

Only see __ what  
You need to see __

To go on __  
The way it must be __

## Chorus 1
Time will tell  
Where he went
 
Was it all lies  
Or just pretend

For the light that dawns every day  
That dawns in your own way __

Would you care  
From whence it came __

## Verse 2
Oh he __  
Will fulfill the needs __

He will stand __  
Don’t care if he bleeds __

## Chorus 2
Time will tell  
Where he went

Was it all lies  
Or just pretend

For the light that dawns every day  
That dawns in your own way  
Would you care  
From whence it came

## Bridge
Oh he’s __ falling apart now  
Oh lost __ every sense of heart now  
Oh he’s __ never getting better  
(Not) again

## Chorus 3
Time will tell  
Where it went

It was all lies  
And a pretense

For the light that dawns every day  
That has to dawn again  
No room to care   
From whence it came
