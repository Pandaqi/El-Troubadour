These are the official lyrics for the song "The Way You". It's track #2 from the album ["A Ship to Something"](/albums/a-ship-to-something). 

## Verse 1
In my mind you’ve been floating for a while  
It’s brand new, it is fleeting  
Some days, I might feel I’m oh so near  
And some days, I keep falling

## Pre-chorus 1
Deal the cards just right  
Keep up hope, by my side

## Chorus 1
I love the way you hold your arms  
Around yourself to keep you warm  
But end up running anyway  
Into my safe arms just to stay

And I’d love the way you’d cheer me up  
When nothing works and I get stuck  
Inside my head with problems I can’t  
Find my way without your hands

## Post-Chorus 1
But I know it will be time for me to go  
When you see my shoulder hanging low  
Oh __

## Verse 2
I can’t work a miracle or dream  
In fact, it’s hard to work at all  
My flesh is as good as I preserve it  
And my mind needs your patience

## Pre-Chorus 2
Give me a chance and I will too  
Throw away the checklist, bury it for you

## Chorus 2
And I love the way you sing my songs  
And even with the words all wrong  
Any melody from you will  
Give me strength to write ten new

And I love the way you’d drag me from  
The endless work and beating drum  
Of hesitation and ambition  
Brewed into a money cocktail

## Post-Chorus 2
That knows the only time for me to go  
Was when I saw your shoulders hanging low

## Bridge
And as I age the list grows longer  
‘Till no puzzle piece will fit at all  
It’s not fair to expect all this from someone  
But god dang it I will try

## Chorus 3
But I would love the way you drink your tea  
Or fold your towels, stand by me  
When sunrise turns into sunset  
Some children running ‘round our head

And I’d love the mess you leave behind  
If space and time would be so kind  
To tangle us and intertwine  
Two lives that just might coincide

## Post-Chorus 3
And the truth is I would let it all go  
If it turns out you’re nothing like this song
