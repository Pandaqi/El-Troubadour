These are the official lyrics for the song "I Miss Seeing Your Face (Part 2)". It's track #6 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

## Verse 1 
Innocent boy  
Where have you gone  
What have you seen  
And now become
 
Wide eyes turned shut  
Had promise but was never  
Found, burnt-up and  
Bound, don’t understand  
Why nothing’s changed  
Occupied by the blame

## Verse 2
Innocent boy  
Where are you now  
Never happy  
Cannot see how  

You could feel like it will all  
Work out, we’ll crawl, if we can’t  
Walk, it’s just stupid  
Talk, don’t understand  
Why anyone would  
Take a risk on the world

## Chorus 1
Innocent boy, can’t recognize  
Your forced disguise, your lies  
What is this face, staring at me

## Verse 3
Innocent boy  
Thrust into this  
Why’d you comply  
You wouldn’t miss  

The long years wasted on tears  
The fear to hear your lower gears  
Are just not enough  
Don’t understand  
How to keep up  
When there’s no room to stop

## Chorus 2
Innocent boy  
When did you die  
It’s been a while  
So smile  

It will be fine  
When you finally die

## Verse 4 (melody change)
Innocent boy  
Now a grown man  
Surrounded by hope  
Imprisoned by plans  
The guiding hand you wistfully spent  
Will break _and_ bend

## Bridge 
Late, late October  
I broke you the news  

The battery’s empty  
Goodbye to your views

Late, late December  
The story confirmed

The old king is dead now  
Long live the king
 
He won’t win  
Who will win, who will win

## Verse 5 (changed key)
Innocent boy  
Burdened by rage  
Trapped in a cage  
Built from spines way too small  
For tasks so tall we must answer the call  
More and more (and more and more)

I’ll stay on the floor

## Chorus 3 (same as part 1)
In meaningful mirrors,  
in the shops, in the lakes  
I miss seeing your face   
Unphased

Where’s the adventurer  
With smile ‘round the eyes  
I miss feeling alive  
And now I don’t __ feel like waking up anymore
