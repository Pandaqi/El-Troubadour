These are the official lyrics for the song "Trip Around the World". It's track #5 from the album ["Don't Forget Me"](/albums/dont-forget-me).

## Verse 1
I wish you luck on your trip around the world  
I wish time would let you fly by  
It’s all for nothing girl

I wish you strength on your walk to sacred grounds  
I wish time would hand you insight  
It’s not for most and it’s certainly not fair

## Chorus 1
Sometimes the good time’s falling apart  
Sometimes we can’t escape from this rollercoaster  
Ride __ I’m falling behind  
Need more time  
Running through our mind __

## Post-Chorus 1
_Stretch out last syllable._

## Verse 2
I wish you love from the people there above  
I wish you would come home safely  
Or it’s all for nothing girl  

I wish you speed on your course around the stone  
I wish I had known your freedom  
But it’s fear I know, and never lets me go

## Chorus 2
Sometimes the good girls run in our head  
Sometimes the light we gave, is the light we never  
Had __ 	I’m wasting my life  
In my mind  
I must have called a thousand times _  

## Post-Chorus 2
_Stretch out last syllable._

## Solo 
_No lyrics._

## Chorus 3
Sometimes the far lands run through our heads  
Sometimes we can’t escape to a life we cannot  
Have __ 	I’m stuck in the grind  
Need more time  
Repeating that same line __  

## Post-Chorus
Time and time and time  
That line that line that line
