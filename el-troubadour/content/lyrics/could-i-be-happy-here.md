These are the official lyrics for the song "Could I Be Happy Here". It's track #2 from the album ["Don't Forget Me"](/albums/dont-forget-me).

## Verse 1 
Go, go, go  
Yet so far __ to go  
You’re done playing child, being young and wild, build a home  
Well maybe I will let you know know know   
But for now I’m reaching for

## Verse 2
Gold, gold, gold  
Put the choi __ ces on hold  
I’m done playing child, want to live my life, make it work  
Well maybe I will see the world world world  
But it all means nothing girl

## Chorus 1 
Could I be __ happy here  
Could I be glad __ that I was where I was supposed to be  
Could a summer day help me to stay  
And luck hides there who knows  
Well anyway

## Post-Chorus 1
Cause today __ anything goes  
And today the summer breeze  
Will blow my  
Way __  
Way __

## Verse 3
And we sleep sleep sleep  
On what we really _ believe  
We let them tell us to work hard and study our youth  
Then we’re older and it’s all a show show show  
It was all for nothing girl

## Verse 4
And then I see see see  
Happy couples _ with dreams  
A job they hate, and a bill to pay, but they’re free  
Stick together and soon bend the knee knee knee  
Now it’s all or nothing girl

## Chorus 2
Could I be happy here  
Could I be glad that I was where I was supposed to be  
Could wisdom come with years to come  
And let me see the truth  
Well anyway

## Post-Chorus 2
Today anything goes
Today the summer breeze will blow my  
Way __ _(repeat x4)_

## Transition
I’m holding on, I’m holding on,  
But out of place I’m not that strong

## Verse 5
So I grow grow grow  
Cause I have __ to know  
Is my purpose just to make money or is to plant?  
I’m yelling at all of our gods gods gods  
But they just can’t pay __ the rent

## Bridge
We keep falling on our only hope  
We drink the drug then we die alone  
And I __ am defeated  
And I barely even care

We keep trying to figure this out  
We follow rules then die without  
A sli __ ver of certainty  
(I) Was supposed to be there

## Post-Chorus 3 (changed key)
Cause today __ anything goes  
Today the summer breeze will blow my    
Way __ _(repeat until fade)_
