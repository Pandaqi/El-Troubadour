These are the official lyrics for the song "Set Sail". It's track #4 from the album ["Don't Give Me Up"](/albums/dont-give-me-up).

## Verse I (variant A)
He said he’d be a better man, yet he walked across the beach  
In search of a way out  
He said he’d give all that he had, yet he did not care the least  
As he heard screams so loud		(saying)

## Verse II (variant B)
Well this one’s for the people and the children  
The fine liars, the buyouts, civilians  
This one’s for the die-hards, the try-hards, the builders  
May the road be long, I say till there’s

Nobody left to live in a cardboard box   
No more deaths, no more threats, no more senseless loss  
If you’re not willing, thrilling to clean your slate  
That’s the worst mistake you will ever make

## Pre-Chorus I 
I could be happy and dancing across the room   
Doing nothing yet screaming impending doom   
But when there’s no-one around  
I recount and count and count and coooount

## Chorus I 
I don’t care what you know,  
I don’t care what you say,  
Only your actions count,  
and your biggest mistakes		(so)

## Post-chorus
Set sail!  
Set saaaaail!  
Your flagship awaits 

_(more like awaaiaiaiaits to make a transition to the next part)_

## Verse III (variant A)
He said he’d sing a better song, yet he stuttered all day long  
Ass tied to the chair

He promised a brighter future now, he promised some more things anyhow  
Until someone declared	that

## Verse IV (variant B)
_Cut short one “phrase”_

This one’s for the haters and creators,  
The dreamers, the schemers, the audacious,  
This one’s for the future, don’t mute her, don’t blame us  
May the road be long I say we will

## Pre-Chorus
Soon be dancing and prancing across our rooms  
All the hard work was done now let’s build some new  
Thoughts and laughs, without me around  
I still sound and sound and sound and soooound

## Chorus II
I don’t care what you’ve seen  
I don’t care what you state  
Only your deeds ring true  
And not your smallest mistakes		(so)

## Post-chorus
Set sail!  
Set saaaail!  
Your flagship awaits

_(Already start building towards the bridge here)_  
Set sail!  
Set saaaail!  
Your flagship awaits

## Bridge 
And I am the runner, the gunner, the perfect  
Line and the story, the lore we’ve been told at  
Night am I scared, do I dare, do I care ask  
Why, that’s your worst mistake, would I ever

Lie am the broker, the no-good composure,  
Wise as the god, who will not even bother,  
Try to be better the getters will never  
Shy, that’s your worst mistake, would I ever

Guide you to waterfalls, hurricanes, whirlpools  
Sigh after failures, I know they will sail us (to)  
Fine lands will meet us and greet us to see us  
Fly, there is no mistake, I’m just saying

## Outro
All parts slowly combine: 
* "Set Sail!"
* "I am ... and I am"
* "I don't care ..."

Until fade out.
