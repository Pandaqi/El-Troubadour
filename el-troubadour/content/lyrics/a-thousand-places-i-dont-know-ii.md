These are the official lyrics for the song "A Thousand Places I Don't Know (Part 2)". It's track #5 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

## Verse 1
He’s falling on the si __ deline  
He’s telling you to stay and yet you run

So full of disappoin __ tment  
Tell everyone your heart just broke and know

## Chorus 1
Will you stay or will you go?  
To a thousand places you don’t know 

## Verse 2
Take poison, let your health __ drop  
Force thoughts away and live like a machine

Drift away to worlds more hand __ some  
Sleep longer and longer to reach where you have been

## Chorus 2
Will you stay or will you go?  
To a thousand places I can’t show  
Will you stay or will you go?  
To a thousand places I can’t go

## Bridge (repeat)
He went down to save his old friend

## Verse 3
Orpheus don’t look back  
There’s no saving when everyone is lost

Orpheus stop looking back  
Twenty years enslaved, oh they’re long gone

## Verse 4 (different melody; same music)
We’re not going anywhere, we’re not going anywhere  
We’re not going anywhere, we’re not going anywhere  
We’re not going, we’re not going,  
we’re not going anywhere anymore

We will never see it all, we will never see it all  
We will never see it all, we will never see it all  
You can only see me fall, see me fall,  
ever closer to the floor

## Chorus 3
Will you take the pill or no?  
To a thousand places you might love  
Will you keep yourself afloat?  
To a thousand places I don’t 

## Chorus 4 (type B; same as part 1)
Know why he  
Never went

Was it all fear  
Or impairment

By the dark he must fight every day  
That never goes away  
Would you care  
From whence it came?

## Outro
It’s a tragedy  
Can’t change the genre halfway 

Through with this  
I cannot live without a
 
Night in Rome  
A garden flower-filled and Paris  
Lights they shone so bright

I miss it so  
The summer sun stripes leaving  
Solid gold  
The weight of worlds left safe at  
Home I know  
It’s just some land, should be a better man  
I like to think I am
