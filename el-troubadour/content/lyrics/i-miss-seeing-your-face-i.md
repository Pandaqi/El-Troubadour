These are the official lyrics for the song "I Miss Seeing Your Face (Part 1)". It's track #3 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

## Verse 1
I will never be your lonesome guard  
Never be the hero in your stone heart  
I am fra __ gile

I will never be your horseback prince  
Never be the savior that holds back sins  
I am bro __ ken

## Chorus 1
If you let me outside  
I will meet you alive  
Cause I miss seeing your face  
Always

Could be forever but  
Forever is long  
To miss seeing your face  
Now I  

Don’t __ feel like waking up anymore  
Now I’m on the floor

## Verse 2
I will never be the richest friend  
Never be the trend that stays ‘till the end  
I’m not ma __ gic  

I will never go where no man’s gone before  
Never lead you to the flower covered courts  
I am sta __ tic  

## Chorus 2
Let’s pretend we’re still young  
We’re scared kids holding on  
And I miss seeing your face  
For days

Could be a classroom,   
Or a carefree Sunday,  
I miss going away  

Now I  
Don’t __ feel like waking up anymore  
Now I’m on the floor

## Bridge
Innocent boy  
Tried oh so hard   
To keep you so close   
And share my old heart

And they say that every  
Minute spent on regret and mistakes  
Will come to pass  
This too shall pass

## Chorus 3
In the quiet sad moments  
In the nights of disgrace  
I miss seeing your face  
Erased

Can’t find the words to  
Tell you how much it weighs  
On me, I just picture your face

Now I  
Don’t __ feel like waking up anymore  
Now I’m on the floor

## Bridge 2
Innocent boy  
Done nothing wrong  
Bad place bad time  
To be there alone

And they say  
That nothing’s permanent  
And those smiles, and the hands, and the jokes,  
And the plans, and the love, and the friends,  
Will surely pass  
This too shall pass

## Outro
I will never be the young boy again  
The Peter Pan with the grand sentiment  
I am ol __ der  
And you are col __ der
