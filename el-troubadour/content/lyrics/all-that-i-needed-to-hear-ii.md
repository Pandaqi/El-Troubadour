These are the official lyrics for the song "All That I Needed to Hear (Part 2)". It's track #8 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

## Verse 1
In your dreams they are  
Flying with fire it’s  
Something worth trying I  
Held out my hand   
To be saved

## Chorus 1
Got denied __

## Verse 2
You’ve been nodding and  
Reasoning seasons will  
Pass and you’ll still be the _(sped up)_ same  
Static noise, no one tuned in

## Chorus 2
I'd fight __

## Verse 3
What they’re saying it’s not  
True and I knew that I  
Slew every dragon but for  
Causes unworthy of my time  

## Chorus 3 
They lied __

## Bridge 1
But when I die  
The world merely shivered, the still alive  
Will move on without question, a memory I’ll be

It’s a fight and the  
Fittest they won’t miss it, but what am I  
If I stay in my seat and watch my life just roll  
By __ 

## Verse 4
So what now boy you’re  
Just gonna run from the  
World let it happen lose your  
Love, lose your soul, lose it all and

## Chorus 4
Stand by __

## Bridge 2
So when I breathe  
A weight will be lifted and I believe  
This is all that I needed to be, so don’t  

Settle down, don’t do any of that  
Nonsense you’ll surely drown  
With a teardrop in my eye, don’t see why I should  
Try __

## Intermezzo
Give me anything, anyone  
Live it anyway, anyhow  
Burn it

No one ever regrets doing  
Something, there’s only the pain of  
Waiting and
 
Wondering  
Why you never dared

## Bridge 3
So when I run  
A voice screaming “listen up, here I come”  
This is all that I needed to hear, so just  

Come undone  
Leave the train, leave the station, find a new home  
Don’t you take this away, it ain’t over ‘till it’s  
Over __
