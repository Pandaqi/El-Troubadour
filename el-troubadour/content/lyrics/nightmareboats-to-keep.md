These are the official lyrics for the song "Nightmareboats to Keep". It's the bonus track from the album ["A Ship to Something"](/albums/a-ship-to-something). 


## Verse 1
Silence again, I don’t know  
Why it just began, was it the  
Way I am speaking  
Do I sound like a grandpa

## Verse 2
Lonely again, I know that  
Somewhere they have fun, is it that  
I’m always working  
Or working for an always

## Chorus 1
If I change what I say  
You would come after me  
If I change my own ways   
Am I still really me?

## Verse 2
Sleeping again, dreaming of  
Ways to change the plan  
But nightmares come easily baby  
For those with great ambition  

## Chorus 2
If I change what I hate  
You would stay beside me  
But if I change my odd ways  
Am I still really me?  

## Bridge
I’ve fought a losing battle  
Since the day I was born

I’ve lost the fighting ammo  
I’m stuck now, tired and worn

But don’t leave me hanging  
Out to dry, I’m fine   
But I still sleep alone at night

## Chorus 3
If I change dreams to play  
You would jump right to me  
But it’s my nightmare to fade  
Away what’s really me

## Outro
_“Doe doe doe doooeh” on verse melody._
