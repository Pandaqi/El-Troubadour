These are the official lyrics for the song "All That I Needed to Hear (Part 1)". It's track #1 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

## Verse 1 
What’s the point, what am  
I here to do

Could we join and just  
Live lives for two

It’s my choice, it’s my voice  
Hopelessly cutting noise  
Remember the simple joys

## Verse 2
I tell truths but they just ask me: “Where  
Are your parents do they know you’re here?”  
No they don’t, far from home  
And they’re not gonna come  
They never cared for long

## Chorus 1
So don’t keep me in your shipyard  
Don’t keep me in the dark  
Don’t waste away your flowers  
On a lone December spark

And I tried to be brave for you  
Oh I __ tried  
To be more than my heart abides

## Verse 3
Put your face on a pedestal dream  
Nigh replaced by improbable screams  
Don’t be still when they kill  
Your loved ones oh they will  
And never come back home

## Chorus 2
So don’t keep me in your tower  
Don’t guard me in the dark  
Don’t waste away the sunshine  
On a lone September spark  

And I tried to surpass for you  
Oh I __ tried  
To be more than my body abides

## Bridge
But there’s one point of failure  
The moment you grow out of your  
  
Skin, and your brain, a whirl-  
Wind of development done

We’re like drops in an  
Ocean of knowledge and  
Meaning but lost it’s a farce  
That keeps pulling our

Tongue away, every day   
Fill the gaps, more is less  
Why grow up if you just

Live __  
With fractures and scars that cannot  
Be unmade, now it’s too late, hey

## Verse 4
Little child put the problem in song  
Fiddled while you knew something was wrong  
Don’t be scared ‘cause I’m there  
Blissfully unaware  
That we’re all going down

## Chorus 3
So don’t tell me I need patience  
Don’t take me for a cheer  
Stop telling what the way is, that’s  
All I needed to hear  

I don’t live (just) to work for you  
Oh I __ knew  
It’ll be tough to reach futures you blew
