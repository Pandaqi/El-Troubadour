These are the official lyrics for the song "Careful Not to Dream (Part 1)". It's track #2 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

## Verse 1
Anything I  
Own, made it on my  
Own, but gone

Careful not to  
Dream there’s miles hidden be-  
Tween your goals

## Chorus 1
Wasted all these years, trying to  
Find what was rightfully mine

Wasted all this time, trying to fly __

## Verse 2 (key raised) 
Anything I  
Know, learnt it on my  
Own with no  
Rest at all, I was

Careful not to  
Dream, the world’s not as it  
Seems and so  
Best not call on the

Gods __ to help you out

## Chorus 2 (same as chorus 1)
Wasted all these years  
Trying to fight what  
Was never my foe

Wasted my reserves  
On empty  
Words

## Bridge
But what if	somehow  
It’s all possible and it’s real  
Would I be the fool who throws it away

But what if dreams of old  
Were strong enough to change the world  
And I am the messenger  
Then why are they all yelling I’m in the wrong

Should I just play along  
It’s all in my head

## Verse 4 / Outro

Anything I own  
Built it from the stones

Anything I loved  
Had to let it go

Anything I dreamt  
Buried in the land

Careful not to dream  
You don’t know what you mean
