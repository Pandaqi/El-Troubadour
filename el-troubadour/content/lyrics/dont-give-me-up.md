These are the official lyrics for the song "Don't Give Me Up". It's track #1 from the album ["Don't Give Me Up"](/albums/dont-give-me-up). 
 
## Verse I
I’ve left you&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;it’s done now  
They’ll catch me&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;don’t hold me up   
I’m falling&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;in the arms of law  
I’ll accept it&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;when there’s no way out

## Verse II
I’m sleeping        it’s tiring   
They’ll follow    don’t wake me up  
I know it	some deeds are not done  
Just go and        love another one  

**Cmaj7**  
Now that I’m really gone

## Verse III
I’m running      you know why  
They’ll call you    don’t give me up  
I promise        not to leave again  
I know now    where this sentence ends

As they handcuff my hands
