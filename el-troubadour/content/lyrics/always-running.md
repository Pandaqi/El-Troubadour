These are the official lyrics for the song "Always Running". It's track #3 from the album ["Don't Give Me Up"](/albums/dont-give-me-up).

## Verse I
That girl, who’s running down the street  
They like you, they’ve loved you all along

Those little things, that have you running on your feet  
You’ll pass through, and show the world you have won

You have friends, you’re not alone  
But always _ running _

## Chorus I
This is your home  
And all we are  
But not how you’re born  
Not who you really are

## Verse II
Your world, you've been trying to understand  
It likes you, it sings you showers of praise  

You won’t hear, but that’s why I’ll be standing here  
To tell you, convince your wins will begin

We have faith, we keep saying so  
Yet always running

## Chorus II
This is your home  
And all we are  
But not how you’re born  
Not who you really are

## Bridge
Well run away  
To your silent hope  
Where they’ll be leaning screaming  
Being evil stealing your whole

Chance to run away  
But don’t you dare go  
To that place you’ll face mistakes and race to waste your dying days

Let us all meet you there to drag you back

## Chorus III
This is your home  
And all we are  
But not how you’re born  
Not who you really are
