These are the official lyrics for the song "Let Your Mind in My Mind". It's track #4 from the album ["Don't Forget Me"](/albums/dont-forget-me).

## Verse 1
It went over my head  
All the things we don’t talk about  
Training liars instead  
Put the food in and shut your mouth  
My my, my my   
What a time, a time

## Intermezzo (2x)  
Hear me, hear me, hear me

## Verse 2
It went over our heads  
All the things we won’t talk about  
Keep the dreams for our beds  
Speak your mind but don’t speak it loud  
My my, my my  
Are we fine, we fine  

## Chorus 1  
I don’t need you to explain this  
I’m not stupid, I’m just young  
When you change my time in your time  
I choke on all this love  
I could not spend __  
_(draw out last syllable)_

## Verse 3
My time like I should  
All the things we can’t talk about  
Trading diamonds for naught  
Teaching things we can do without  
My my, my my  
What a lie, a lie  

## Chorus 2
I don’t need you to be perfect  
My heart is big enough  
When you push your life in my life  
It’s all for which I fought  
So let it in __  
_(draw out last syllable)_

## Transition
If you scream and no one’s around  
No identity hearing those sounds  
What use is the perfect life well-spent  
Without an unexpected hand __

## Bridge
I’ve slept in soft beds, since I was young   
I’ve lived in freedom, or so I’ve been told __  
Entertainment to spare, blankets and a teddy bear  
More food than I can swallow, people too many to know  

But it’s not the same, it’s really not the same 

As a mind unique as yours,  
Breaking the ceiling raising floors    
To do as you like, but close to me  
To make up your mind and make me see __

## Chorus 3
I don’t need you to remind me  
My dreams are big enough  
When you let your mind in my mind  
It sings a brand-new song  
I did not write __  

And that’s what I like

## Intermezzo (2x)
So hear me, hear me, hear me
