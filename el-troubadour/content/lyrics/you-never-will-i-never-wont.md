These are the official lyrics for the song "You never will, I never won't". It's track #1 from the album ["A Ship to Something"](/albums/a-ship-to-something). 

## Verse 1
I’ve been turning, waking, restless  
About the way the world should be  
Can’t forget you just would not agree  
You never saw, I always see

## Verse 2
I wish some time machine could save me  
From old mistakes you don’t believe  
Can’t forget this was not what I planned  
You never can, I never can’t

## Chorus 1
See ____ me as I plead  
Down on my knees  
If I could’ve been anyone else

If you had left the chain  
Give me a day, believe me I’ll  
Fly ___

## Verse 3
It never even came to heartbreak  
By then the brain cells were all numb  
Endless searching, I never came home  
You never will, I never won’t

## Verse 4 
And now I’m running from the answers  
I do not like them they’re not __ me  
Raised by monsters, how can you grow free?  
You’ll never die, I’ll never be

## Chorus 2
Hear __ me as I scream  
Split at the seams I can’t  
Bleed anymore  

The hurt that used to burn  
Has turned to ice  
One more push and I’ll die

## Bridge 1
Oh I’ll  
Die – the prospect of not making it  
Out alive flashes by – and it  
Scares me, what I will never do, what I will never make  
Twenty wasted years, what is twenty more?

You won’t expect it, that’s the best part, it is proving you were  
Wrong dear, that’s the best part, it is proving you were  
Wrong dear, admit it, you never will, I never won’t

## Bridge 2
Oeh __  
Only one feeling left, use it well

Oeh __  
Got something to prove, nothing to lose

Oeh __  
A goal is a goal, let it go

Oeh __  
Pester the gods with your stubbornness

Oeh __  
Don’t need to be right, I have

## Chorus 3/Outro
Time ___ right on my side  
Why turn unstoppable tides

You will never love me back like that  
You will never give me back what I had
You never will, I never  

Won’t __  
Feel that way again
