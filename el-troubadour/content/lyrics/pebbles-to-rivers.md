These are the official lyrics for the song "Pebbles to Rivers". It's track #4 from the album ["A Ship to Something"](/albums/a-ship-to-something). 

## Verse 1
It’s no problem  
It’s all fine, it’s quite alright  
They will understand I mean it well  
Given some time

## Verse 2
Just a white lie  
Some truth withheld, means to an end  
I need a problem solved, a helping hand  
So draw the line

## Pre-Chorus 1
Again again again again again  
The same _(split up like the phrase above; “sa – y – a – y – me”)_  
Fault in our  
Brains

## Chorus 1
We dance, we lie, we break  
We do this all a thousand times  
Explain it all away – the  
Misleading words spit from our mouths we

Keep our wrongs at bay  
But it’s not okay  

A small leak will grow, a mistake will sow  
Pebbles in rivers __  
Soon rock the world with their waves

## Verse 3
Why not start now  
Why not take the first step leading there  
Every day a stone to stack and stall  
Soon builds a wall

## Verse 4
Get the rivers flowing  
Even subtle streams are always going  
To a common goal a larger whole  
Without the need for greed to push underneath

## Pre-Chorus 2
Again again again again again  
You can _  
Choose to be more

## Chorus 2
We hide, we steal, we crave  
We do this all a thousands times, we  

Seal our hearts away – ruin  
Lives just to keep dignity, we

Only look ahead  
At most a day  

But a seed will grow, even small stars they glow  
Pebbles in rivers __  
Soon overflow our brick walls and they cannot be stopped

## Bridge 1
Remember days when we would share a bed  
Whenever we were cold

Remember weeks when we just did not speak  
For reasons that we lost

Remember months when you’d raise me up  
When I just could not hold

Onto something and keep flowing along  
Every day a little harder

## Bridge 2
Remember every time you’d tell me off  
For something that’s not wrong

Remember every lecture lacking love  
When I just wanted hope

Remember your ever present need to shine  
When any step would’ve been fine

How could you wonder what made me what I am  
Every day a little cruel

## Chorus 3
We sleep, we dream, we wake  
We do this all a thousand times, each  

Day a new blank slate – to be  
Thankful, fearful, or cower and wait

Don’t let the moment pass  
Make them all last

Two small steps a jump, every creation a bump  
Pebbles in rivers __  
Can somehow lead to an architecture to behold
