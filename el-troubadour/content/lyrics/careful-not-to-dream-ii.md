These are the official lyrics for the song "Careful Not to Dream (Part 2)". It's track #7 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

## Verse 1
Baby give me Armageddon  
All I had is gone  
As I move on  
To a place we both know

Baby don’t leave me hanging  
Cause I am hanging on

## Chorus 1
Now there’s nothing to fear for  
There’s nothing to __ fear  
As I’m waiting here in sunlight and soft beds 

I’m keeping faith in the  
Way mistakes make you  
Grow&emsp;&emsp;and soon all will know __

## Verse 2
Baby listen to my words now  
All the hurt goes down  
When you’re around  
You need not make a sound   
Baby I will come running  
To see your stunning frown

## Chorus 2
And there’s nothing to fear for  
There’s nothing to __ fear  
We are late to the party but we’re here  
I’m keeping faith in the  
Way dreams give you a  
Strength to rise each day again __  

## Bridge (same as bridge of part 1)
But what if I end up succeeding  
Despite all the odds  
Was it worth the time wasted in bed

Are you looking for impressive feats?  
Or just a boy who keeps his dreams   
Like jewels proudly on display  
But never so foolish to chase them down  

What is truly wise and sound  
What you ask is … 

## Chorus 3 (softer, more like a lullaby)
Make there nothing to fear for  
Nothing to __ fear  
Make us safe, warm and fed, make us play __  
Please keep our faith in the  
Way a life will turn   
Out what you put in __

## Outro
Anything I own  
Left it on the stones

Careful not to dream  
The lies still make you gleam

Anything I own  
Built from the unknown

Careful not to dream  
It’s real, so it might seem  
(These days)
