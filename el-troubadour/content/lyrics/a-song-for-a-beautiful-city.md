These are the official lyrics for the song "A Song for a Beautiful City". It's track #6 from the album ["Don't Forget Me"](/albums/dont-forget-me).

## Verse 1
In the lights of the city  
I drew up the stars just for you  
Seen through the lenses of   
Millions of people, they met her   
It is such a pity  
That we can’t be together

## Verse 2
In the lights of the city  
I showed you the way to the heart  
Seen through the glasses of  
Millions of buildings, they get her  
It is such a pity  
That we can’t be together  

## Chorus
But baaaabyyy   
Tonight you look so bella  
Tonight you’d steal the thunder from the sun  
And we’ve only just begun we’re  
Dancing ‘till its dawn  
Because I want you  
Baby I still need you   
To redirect my life  
It lacks fire and true desire  
When we can’t be together

## Verse 3
In the lights of the city  
I let go all fears just for you  
And through the masses  
Of interesting people, I let her  
It’s just such a pity  
That we can’t stay together

## Verse 4
In the lights of the city  
I ran down my youth just for fun  
And through the rainstorms  
The cold nights and moonlights, I weather  
It was such a pity  
That we were not together

## Chorus 2
Because baby __  
Tonight you look so bella  
Tonight you’d steal the fire from the stars  
And we’ve only just begun to  
Find which part is ours  

Because I want you  
Baby I still need you  
To redirect my soul  
It’s not whole, it’s on hold  
When we are not together

## Solo
_No lyrics._

## Chorus 3
Because baby __  
Tonight you look so bella  
Tonight you’d rob the water of its flow  
And we’ve only just begun to  
Really get to know  

That I want you  
Baby I still need you  
To redirect my mind  
It needs air, neon pairs,  
Cause we are not together
