These are the official lyrics for the song "Dreamboats to Share". It's track #3 from the album ["A Ship to Something"](/albums/a-ship-to-something). 

## Verse 1			
I need the freedom to grow this  
I’ve adventures to sell		and a way to let go it  
Is not the same as working the paychecks  
It’s not the same at all, dear

## Verse 2
I need this noise to blow over  
I have stories to share, and an ending so cruel it  
Will leave the stone-cold faced with a heartbreak  
And they’ll (finally?) turn around to listen  

## Chorus 1
Why won’t you meet me in the park  
Why would you wait until it’s dark  
Why would you hide away till noon  

Why leave your masterpiece inside  
Why shield the power of your mind  
Why take the blame for just your name

Bills coming, lights flooding and  
I’m drowning and
I __  
And I __

## Verse 3
I need the world to turn winter  
I’ve got warm hugs to spare, and by now it’s beginning  
To eat itself out of my soul  
And it needs a place to anchor

## Verse 4
(But) first I need the ocean to calm down  
I’ve got dreamboats to share, and some walls that will fall down  
If I only saw a light that could guide me  
To the end of strange endeavors

## Chorus 2
Oh won’t you give me what I want  
Won’t you wander into hearts  
Won’t you see this work complete  

Why would you force me into this  
Why restrict me to one kiss (?)  
Why not keep the thoughts you need

Expectations, no vacations (?)  
But it’s worth it if  
I __ , if I __ am allowed

## Bridge 
To yell, to tell, to be myself,  
To share, and tear apart the wealth  
Of wrong and right and whatever’s left of that

To write, to sing, to make a thing,  
That spreads and grows and has me cling  
To walls and chairs by the sheer enormity

The flood gates open  
Do not tell me to stay silent and sit still  
If given the option  
Everyone, everyone would choose to believe

## Verse 5
I need the sun to rise hopeful  
I need someone to care, for me I’m a handful  
But I hope (that) a hand full of magic  
Is not so heavy a burden

## Verse 6
I want a quiet house on a hillside  
I have madness to bear, and I need to go outside  
It’s not that I don’t like the company  
My wild thoughts just need sorting (?)

## Chorus 3
Oh won’t you play this on repeat  
Why don’t you steal the parts you need  
Why must we begin from greed (?)

Oh will you listen to my tale  
My success and how I fail  
No adventure can grow stale

With my eyes open, wide mind open  
And I’m hoping that  
I __ can, that I __ can  
That I__ can, I__ can  
Satisfy
