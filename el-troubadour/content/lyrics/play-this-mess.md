These are the official lyrics for the song "Play This Mess". It's track #3 from the album ["Feast your Eyes on Me"](/albums/feast-your-eyes-on-me). 

## Verse 1
Hey lady from my memory  
I still hear your words in dreams  
Like a map you drew the lines of my intentions  
Just your voice, dark nights and silent screams

## Verse 2
Hey someone who could love me  
Say goodbye to all your fears  
We can just pretend that I was never here  
It’s just that comfort song you hear

## Chorus 1
Oh darling darling  
You don’t have to make a choice  
If you want to, you can just  
Play my voice    
On the radio

## Verse 3
Hey ghosts hiding in cupboards  
Hey monsters under the bed  
What’s it like to be feared by so many  
Yet never get any respect

## Chorus 2
Oh baby baby  
You don’t have to be distressed  
If you want to  
You can just play this mess  
On your radio

## Hook (5x)
All the voices in your head  
All those things I never said

## Bridge 1
We’re bruised, bent, and broken  
There’s no use denying  
The words finally spoken  
My poetic trying all leads to  
You ___

## Chorus 3
Oh lovely, lovely  
I’ll be gone before too long  
But if you want to  
You can just finish this song  
On your own sweet time

## Verse 4
Hey parts of you that loved me  
Meet the words killed before speak  
A stranger’s lips will sing my melody  
The cards were dealt and so I yield  

## Chorus 4
Cause sweetheart, sweetheart  
I’ll admit to one more fear  
There won’t be songs of mine  
That you will ever hear  
On the radio
