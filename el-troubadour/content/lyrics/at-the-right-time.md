These are the official lyrics for the song "At the right time". It's track #1 from the album ["Feast your Eyes on Me"](/albums/feast-your-eyes-on-me). 

## Verse 1
I spoke to a God today  
And he was weeping softly  
About the humans trapped in rage  
Trapped in their golden cage

## Verse 2
I spoke with a God today  
And he was weeping slowly  
About the way the world should be  
And he mourned us

## Chorus 1  
What if the world stops spinning  
What if the oceans rise and  
I’m left wondering  
About the way it all went down   
Did I fight back at the right time  
Did I speak up just enough

## Verse 3
I spoke with our God today  
And he was cursing sadly  
The state of affairs in the world out there  
And everything could have been better  

## Chorus 2
What if the world stops spinning  
What if the oceans rise and  
I’m left wondering  
Did I do the sane thing  
Did I do the right things at the right time  
Did I say the right things to the  

## Bridge (type 1)
Lost souls and their  
Lost souls enter the fray

## Verse 4
I spoke with your God today  
And he was leaving surely  
For all the humans trapped in guilt  
Would never rebuild this  

## Chorus 3
World that will keep on spinning  
We’ll let the oceans rise  
And I’m left wondering  
Was it worth the fake sense of joy  
Was it worth it to sleep softly  
Was it worth it just enough  

## Bridge (type 2)
I’ll kneeeel before death’s door  
One day, sailing for the liiiighthouse  
But we will never, we will never reach the shore ...

... sure-ly there’s a plan  
But what role will I play there  
Many drops make a waterfall  
Sparks of hope make the mighty monarchs fall

## Solo
No lyrics here, obviously.

## Outro
_(only lightly sung, fading out)_  
Did I do everything I could?  
Did I speak up at the right time?  
Did I fight back just enough?
