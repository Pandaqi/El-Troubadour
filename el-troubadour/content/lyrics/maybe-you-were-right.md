These are the official lyrics for the song "Maybe you were right". It's track #2 from the album ["Feast your Eyes on Me"](/albums/feast-your-eyes-on-me). 

## Verse 1
They say the beauty’s in the pause  
The memory shines when it’s lost  
Guess I will never forget

## Verse 2
They say you cannot force a spark  
The light’s much brighter in dark  
But I have to close my eyes

## Pre-Chorus 1
So you see it’s all a mess  
I’ll just work with what I have

## Chorus 1								
And I believe that there’s a place  
where it will find me and I’ll do it all

But you believed that I’m just running, fleeing,  
with my back against the wall

But I will conquer countries,  
sail my ship to worlds unknown

Or you will hear me saying,  
maybe you were riiiiiiiight ___ 

## Verse 3
You say I have to slow it down  
I’m just met with a frown _(half tempo)_  
With this time and space I drown

## Verse 4
You say, some silence would be nice  
_(no lyrics/silence for one bar)_  
Guess your wish comes at a price

## Pre-Chorus 2 
It’s a bitter realization  
That my age is not my skill  
Still don’t know my occupation  
But I guess I never will  
I never will

## Chorus 2
Feel like my work is done my mind  
can rest now I am satisfied

You feel my body’s drained, the age old test  
is will I make it to the night

But hey I made some things,  
I made a thing out of thin air

And now I make excuses,  
‘cause maybe you were riiiiight __

Maybe in my mind  
Things are not as fine  
Maybe you were right

## Solo
_No lyrics_

## Verse 5
But if I may be so bold  
I guess to have and to hold   
Means to live under sun

## Pre-Chorus 
With your arms outstretched  
Only thoughts of you in my head

## Chorus
But first I’ll have to find you,  
get you, keep you, never let you go

My world so far was numbers, papers,  
and a future growing cold

I guess I could make space,  
for a few days, for better ways

And when we greet the night,  
I’ll say maybe you were riiiiight ___

Maybe we have time  
Maybe I need a guide  
Maybe you were right
