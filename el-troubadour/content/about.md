Hello! I am **Tiamo** (el troubadour), an independent musician from the Netherlands. 

## My Style

My musical brain is, somehow, divided into four parts.

I love [singer-songwriter stuff](/tags/singer-songwriter), small songs with just a piano and a voice, cute melodies or heartbreaking lyrics.

But I also love [folk/pop/rock](/tags/folk-pop-rock) - the stomping your foot, shouting along, breaking your guitar strings kind.

But I also grew up in the theatre, creating a love for [musical theatre songs](/tags/musical-theatre). I'm just as likely to start belting "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables" as I am to sing some obscure Mumford & Sons song.

And due to the health issues I'll explain below, I also make [instrumental](/tags/instrumental) music from time to time.

## My Body

I picked up my first guitar at the age of seven. From then, the dream of becoming a full-time (probably famous, and rich) musician was on.

I learned piano, drums, took singing lessons, spent years training and preparing ... but it just wasn't meant to be.

A chronic illness rages through my body and makes me unable to make music whenever I want. My abilities are very inconsistent, and I need many breaks.

It took a long time to "accept" that, in which I wrote literally hundreds of songs. 

But now I'm bundling those songs into albums (mostly in chronological order), trying to record at least an hour every week, so I can present my music to the world!

## My Work

Because of those health issues, I've decided to hedge my bets! 

I work as a general freelance artist, also writing, drawing, designing, and more.

To view an overview of all my work, visit my [Portfolio](https://rodepanda.com).

My game studio has a separate website: [Pandaqi](https://pandaqi.com).

And my writing has its own home as well, although that is only in Dutch (!): [Niet Dat Het Uitmaakt](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl).

## Contact

Email is the magic word!

**(Live) Performances?** Due to my health issues, I'm not touring or doing (live) performances. I have dreams and high hopes, obviously, but it's unlikely that will ever be a reality for me.

**Social media?** I understand the power and importance of social media ... but I value my time, health and integrity more.

These days, social media is nothing more than a huge channel through which everyone promotes and advertises, and at best a time sink for everyone else.

I'm not going to spam my music on a website I don't even use or enjoy myself. Especially if it costs me a few hours in which I could've made *more music* and *better music*.
