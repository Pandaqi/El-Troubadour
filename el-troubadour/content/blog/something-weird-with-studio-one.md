I've been using **Studio One** for (almost) all my music work for _ages_ now. 

But only recently, when I started doing some things (that weren't that easy/possible in S1) in other DAWs, I noticed something weird: **Studio One makes everything less loud?**

When inside S1, anything I play back sounds significantly softer than when I export the file as an MP3 and listen anywhere else.

I can literally work on a song and comfortably hear it at a certain volume, but when I close S1 and listen to the mixdown of what I was just working on _at the same volume_, it's _uncomfortably loud_.

I've searched the settings, I've checked any templates or defaults, I keep checking if I accidentally lowered my "Main" bus or something, but it's none of that. It's just something built into the software, I suspect, or how it interacts with my specific laptop (which is also the only device I've had for _ages_ now). Reinstalling does nothing, I've tried it all.

More people have this issue of "playback just being a bit softer inside S1", none with satisfying answers. It doesn't feel like a _bug_ really, or that annoying. It's just something I had to learn about. 

When I bought my first proper microphone and audio interface, and connected it to S1, I thought I had made a mistake and bought something with very little gain. But I was just being an idiot and had my audio interface set to split the sound 50% between DAW and input, meaning everything I played back was half as soft as it actually was. (And it mixed in the room noise from the microphone as well, meaning I'd constantly hear _myself_ sniffling or shuffling over the playback, thinking the recordings had to be redone.) The fact that S1 _also_ lowered the volume a bit, gave me a few panicky hours back then.

By now, I've learned that basically any microphone/interface will have a very low noise floor, so you can record things quite soft and always go louder/softer afterwards. My gear, even though it's quite cheap and old by now, is as good as any. If it has any problems, _volume_ is certainly not one of them :p

Still, if you have this as well, or know what might be the problem, let me know.

(One of those other DAWs is Reaper. Whatever I put into that is just _so much louder_ than anywhere else. So they are doing the same thing, but in reverse? Or is that the _actual_ volume of the track? I don't know, but I've learnt to live with it, as I don't have money for newer and better hardware :p)

Onto better music!
