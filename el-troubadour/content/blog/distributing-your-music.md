Recently, I've made the jump to "professionally" distributing my music. For years, I've been (irregularly) putting small songs on YouTube and BandCamp, but now I wanted to get serious. 

I had songs to record, albums to make, music to bring to the world. 

So I looked into many music distributors, eventually chose DistroKid, and want to tell you my thoughts in this article.
