## More Info

Years ago, when I wanted to start seriously recording my music, I collected the oldest songs I'd ever written. Out of a collection of about ten of them, I chose these four because I thought they were "doable" for me and thought they'd make a nice first EP.

Since then, a folder with these songs floated around my computer for years ... and I somewhat forgot about it. When I encountered it again, I knew "I have to record this now, or I will never do it again". And so I did.

I thought the songs were too good to forget, but not good enough to add to later albums. After all, these were my very first creations. And so I recorded them, tried to learn even more about mixing and audio engineering, and gave it to the world!
