A set of four instrumental compositions (2 piano, 2 guitar) about an impactful event from my youth: the sudden death of my older brother.

This EP has a "twin" called ["Dawn"](/albums/dawn). This means that both EPs are connected through theme, instrumentation, composition, and more, and it's best to listen to them after each other (Dusk -> Dawn).

## More Info

As always, I've written an article on the blog about the creation of this album: [Notes on "Dusk"](/blog/notes-on-dusk)

It's the second instrumental album I've ever made, and the first with solo guitar. As such, I admit to the audio quality not being optimal. This album was my reason to buy proper gear and start taking this seriously.

Soon I will see if a "remaster" can be done.
