A mini-album with 5 songs, mixing different types of guitar, different styles, and different emotions. My third EP and the first one I'd call somewhere near professional.

## More Info

The past year I recorded 3 albums and one single, which taught me _a lot_. With this album, I was finally able to apply all that wisdom, right from the start.

I stopped recording stuff too loud, which always caused problems down the road. I added more instruments (instead of just one type of guitar) early on and considered them when writing the songs. I finally had two microphones, allowing me to record single, soft, plucked guitar parts nicely. And I learned some tricks to prevent me from singing out of tune with headphones on.

That, and many other small tricks and techniques, led to this album being much cleaner (and quicker to make) than the others! If I may say so myself, I think we're nearing a professional level of music production. (Of course, still lots to learn and a long way to go before winning any Grammy's :p)
