A mini-album with 5 songs, going back to my roots: just a guitar and my voice, playing while singing. Personal, intimate songs with both interesting vocal melodies as well as guitar melodies.

## More Info

My previous albums became much bigger than I anticipated, with songs that started to sound more like a _full band_ than a _singer-songwriter melody_ after a while. This took too much time and drifted a bit from my own style and vision.

So I vowed to do one album with just guitar and voice, see what it leads to. In the end, other instruments _were_ added and some mixing was done just to make it all sound better and more exciting at certain points. But the main vocal, guitar, melody, everything is always a live take of me playing and singing at the same time.
