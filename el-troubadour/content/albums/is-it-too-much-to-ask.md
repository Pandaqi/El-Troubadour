A mini-album with 5 acoustic songs, using my Spanish guitar and my voice. Full of harmonies, intricate guitar parts, surprising melodies and thought-provoking lyrics. And the odd instrument thrown in there that is _not_ a guitar.

## More Info

Adding more instruments (than just guitar) adds more possibilities and makes some things easier ... but also presented new challenges. I was actually a bit overwhelmed by the obstacles along the route to "learning how to mix/master your own music", causing me to put down the project for a while (nearly 6 months).

When I picked it up again, I'd gained some more experience (such as creating a Christmas song with a full band). I listened to the full album once, while writing down my thoughts. This led to two pages full of scribbled notes, which I fixed/improved and then called the album done. Most of them came down to: 
* "Add more instruments here to add power and fill up space, guitar can only do so much"
* "Less reverb, some more volume on the voice"
* This part sounds wrong/bad/out of tune => re-record it

In the end, these "tweaks" did a lot for the album. By no means perfect &mdash; it's only my second try &mdash; but already a bit more complete than my first album.
