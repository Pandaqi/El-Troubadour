These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Play This Mess". It's track #3 from the album ["Feast your Eyes on Me"](/albums/feast-your-eyes-on-me). 

One of the simpler, quieter songs. Best played with a leisurely picking pattern, not forcing anything.

As usual with my songs, however, it goes crazy with some chords during the bridge.
* C/B = X20030 _(not that well-known as a chord)_
* Dsus2 = X54030 _(used in chorus for interest)_
* Em\* = X70080
* D\* = X50070
* C\* = X30050
* G\* = X10 0 0 12 0
* D\F#\* = X9 0 0 10 0

## Intro
This is the "hook" of the song that keeps reappearing at the start, middle, and end.

## Verse 1
**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
&emsp;&emsp;Hey lady from my memory  
I still hear your words in dreams

**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
&emsp;Like a map you drew the lines of my intentions

**Em**		**D**		**C**  
Just your voice, dark nights and silent screams

## Verse 2
Hey someone who could love me  
Say goodbye to all your fears  
We can just pretend that I was never here  
It’s just that comfort song you hear

## Chorus 1
**C/B**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cadd9**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Oh darling darling  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You don’t have to make a choice  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If you want to, you can just  

**Dsus2**  
Play my voice

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em** **D** **C**  
On the radio

## Verse 3
Hey ghosts hiding in cupboards  
Hey monsters under the bed  
What’s it like to be feared by so many  
Yet never get any respect

## Chorus 2
Oh baby baby  
You don’t have to be distressed  
If you want to  
You can just play this mess  
On your radio

## Hook (5x)
**Em**&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;All the voices in your head

**D/F#**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;All those things I never said

## Bridge 1
**Em\***&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D\*** **C/B** **C\*** **C/B**  
&emsp;&emsp;We’re bruised, bent, and broken

**Em\***&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D\*** **C/B** **C\*** **D\***  
&emsp;&emsp;There’s no use denying

The words finally spoken  
My poetic trying all leads to

**G\*** **D/F#\*** **Em\*** **D\*** **C\***  
You ___

## Chorus 3
Oh lovely, lovely  
I’ll be gone before too long  
But if you want to  
You can just finish this song  
On your own sweet time

## Verse 4
Hey parts of you that loved me  
Meet the words killed before speak  
A stranger’s lips will sing my melody  
The cards were dealt and so I yield  

## Chorus 4
Cause sweetheart, sweetheart  
I’ll admit to one more fear  
There won’t be songs of mine  
That you will ever hear  
On the radio  

## Outro
Just play the hook again and again, fading out
