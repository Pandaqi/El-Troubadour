These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "All That I Needed to Hear (Part 1)". It's track #1 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

Obviously an angry song. Sing and play it that way. The guitar is all downward strumming (quickly) throughout the song.

## Intro
**D** _(repeated aggressive downward strumming)_

## Verse 1 
**D**  
What’s the point, what am

**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
I here to do

Could we join and just  
Live lives for two

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
It’s my choice, it’s my voice

**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Hopelessly cutting noise

**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
Remember the simple joys

## Verse 2
I tell truths but they just ask me: “Where  
Are your parents do they know you’re here?”  
No they don’t, far from home  
And they’re not gonna come  
They never cared for long

## Chorus 1
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
So don’t keep me in your shipyard

&emsp;&emsp;**Bm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
Don’t keep me in the dark

&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
Don’t waste away your flowers

&emsp;&emsp;**B7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
On a lone December spark

&emsp;&emsp;**F**  
And I tried to be brave for you

&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
Oh I __ tried

**D/F#**&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
&emsp;&emsp;To be more than my heart abides

## Verse 3
Put your face on a pedestal dream  
Nigh replaced by improbable screams  
Don’t be still when they kill  
Your loved ones oh they will  
And never come back home

## Chorus 2
So don’t keep me in your tower  
Don’t guard me in the dark  
Don’t waste away the sunshine  
On a lone September spark  

And I tried to surpass for you  
Oh I __ tried  
To be more than my body abides

## Bridge
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
But there’s one point of failure  
The moment you grow out of your  

**Em**  
Skin, and your brain, a whirl-

**G**  
Wind of development done

We’re like drops in an  
Ocean of knowledge and  
Meaning but lost it’s a farce  
That keeps pulling our

**Am**  
Tongue away, every day

**C/B**  
Fill the gaps, more is less

**C**  
Why grow up if you just

**Em**  
Live __

**D**  
With fractures and scars that cannot

**C**  
Be unmade, now it’s too late, hey

## Verse 4
Little child put the problem in song  
Fiddled while you knew something was wrong  
Don’t be scared ‘cause I’m there  
Blissfully unaware  
That we’re all going down

## Chorus 3
So don’t tell me I need patience  
Don’t take me for a cheer  
Stop telling what the way is, that’s  
All I needed to hear  

I don’t live (just) to work for you  
Oh I __ knew  
It’ll be tough to reach futures you blew

## Outro
_Slow down strumming on **D** until done_
