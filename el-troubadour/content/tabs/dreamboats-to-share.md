These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Dreamboats to Share". It's track #3 from the album ["A Ship to Something"](/albums/a-ship-to-something). 

Pretty standard chords and strumming patterns. It only switches to some weird chords (and a different vibe/pattern) in the bridge, but those are explained when you get there.

## Notes
Capo V

The bridge uses loads of different chords. I thought it best to write them there, when they appear.

## Verse 1
**G**  
I need the freedom to grow this

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D/F#**  
I’ve adventures to sell, and a way to let go it

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
Is not the same as working the paychecks

**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
It’s not the same at all, dear

## Verse 2
I need this noise to blow over  
I have stories to share, and an ending so cruel it  
Will leave the stone-cold faced with a heartbreak  
And they’ll turn around to listen

## Chorus 1
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
Why won’t you meet me in the park

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
Why'd you wait until it’s dark

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Why'd you hide away till noon

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
Why leave your masterpiece inside

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Gm**  
Shield the power of your mind

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Take the blame for just your name

**D/F#**  
&emsp;&emsp;Bills coming, lights flooding and

**B7**  
&emsp;&emsp;I’m drowning and

**Cmaj7 (032000)**  
I __

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dmaj7 (054000)**  
And I __

## Verse 3
I need the world to turn winter  
I have warm hugs to spare, and by now it’s beginning  
To eat itself a way out of my soul  
And it needs a place to anchor  

## Verse 4
(But) first I need the ocean to calm down  
I’ve got dreamboats to share, and some walls that will fall down  
If I just saw a light that could guide me  
To the end of strange endeavors

## Chorus 2
Oh won’t you give me what I want  
Won’t you wander into hearts  
Won’t you see this work complete

Why'd you force me into this  
Why restrict me to one kiss 
Why not keep the thoughts you miss

Expectations, no vacations
But it’s worth it if  
I __ , if I __ am allowed

## Bridge

**Em = X75080**    
To yell, to tell, to be myself

**Cdim = X324XX**  
To share, and tear apart the wealth

**B7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em\***  
&emsp;Of wrong and right and whatever’s left of that

**C/B**  
To write, to sing, to make a thing, 

**A7 = X00020**  
That spreads and grows and has me cling  

**B/D# = X6X45X**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
To walls and chairs by the sheer enormity

**Cdim**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bbdim = X12023**  
The flood gates open		

**F#7**  
Don't tell me to stay silent and sit still

**Bm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**(Bm/A)**&emsp;**G**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If given the option		

**Bm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bm/D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F#7**  
Everyone, everyone would choose to believe

**B7**	**D7** _(back to)_ **G**

## Verse 5
I need the sun to rise hopeful  
I need someone to care, for me I’m a handful  
But I hope (that) a hand full of magic  
Is not so heavy a burden

## Verse 6
I want (a) quiet house on a hillside  
I have madness to bear, and I need to go outside  
It’s not that I don’t like the company  
My wild thoughts just need sorting

## Chorus 3
Oh won’t you play this on repeat  
Why don’t you steal the parts you need  
Why must we begin from greed 

Oh will you listen to my tale  
My success and how I fail  
No adventure can grow stale

With my eyes open, mind wide open  
And I’m hoping that  
I __ can, that I __ can  
That I__ can, I__ can  
Satisfy
