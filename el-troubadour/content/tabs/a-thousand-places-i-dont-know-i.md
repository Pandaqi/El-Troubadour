These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "A Thousand Places I Don't Know (Part 1)". It's track #4 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

The only song of the album (including its part 2) that's not very angry or sad, and perhaps needs some more instruments/voices to sound great. 

(Because of the long held notes and the plucking pattern on the guitar that's quite _high_. It just means it sounds a bit thin with just guitar and voice.)

## Notes
**Capo 7**. Chords:
* **C/D** = 050030
* **F\*** = 100010

## Intro

## Verse 1
&emsp;**Am**  
Oh he __ is 

&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Falling away __

Told him not __ to  
Run but to stay

Only see __ what  
You need to see __

To go on __  
The way it must be __

## Chorus 1
**C**&emsp;**C/B**&emsp;**Am**  
Time will tell

**G**&emsp;**D/F#**&emsp;**Em**  
Where he went

**C**&emsp;**C/B**&emsp;**Am**  
Was it all lies

&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;**D/F#**  
Or just pretend

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
For the light that dawns every day

**G**&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C/B**  
That dawns in your own way __

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;**C/D**  
Would you care

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**&emsp;**G**&emsp;**Em**  
From whence it came __

## Verse 2
Oh he __  
Will fulfill the needs __

He will stand __  
Don’t care if he bleeds __

## Chorus 2
Time will tell  
Where he went

Was it all lies  
Or just pretend

For the light that dawns every day  
That dawns in your own way  
Would you care  
From whence it came

## Solo
**@TODO**

A heavy guitar solo feels most suited here. (Perhaps with big, reverby “ooh” choir voices along it. Like the end of act 1 from a musical, where the character is going down and down and down and it’s all going wrong.)
Idea: re-use the intro pluckings here. (Otherwise feels like a waste of a unique melody/chord progression.)

## Bridge
&emsp;**F\***&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Oh he’s __ falling apart now  
Oh lost __ every sense of heart now  
Oh he’s __ never getting better  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
(Not) again

## Chorus 3
Time will tell  
Where it went

It was all lies  
And a pretense

For the light that dawns every day  
That has to dawn again  
No room to care   
From whence it came

## Outro
_Play the chorus chords, but sped up, using the G-string for a “2->0” hammer-on note._

_If you want, you can move the hammer note higher and higher as you go._

_This is a terrible explanation, but I’m not going to make a detailed tab of that._
