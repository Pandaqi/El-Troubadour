These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "I Miss Seeing Your Face (Part 2)". It's track #6 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

This song is rather long. And, again, quite angry all the way through. And the later verses (with shifted melody) are tough to sing on the high notes. Conclusion? Try this song at your own risk.

(The chords are quite easy though and the strumming really consistent. So that's nice.)

_Remark:_ the first four phrases of the verses, you can alternate that **C** chord with pretty much anything. Dm. Dm/C. F. D. Try whatever you like.

## Intro
**C** _(aggressive downward strumming)_

## Verse 1 
**C**  
Innocent boy  
Where have you gone  
What have you seen  
And now become

**Am**  
Wide eyes turned shut  
Had promise but was never

**G**  
Found, burnt-up and

**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Bound, don’t understand

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
Why nothing’s changed

&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;**G**    
Occupied by the blame

## Verse 2
**C**  
&emsp;Innocent boy  

**G**  
&emsp;Where are you now  

**C**  
&emsp;Never happy  

**G**
&emsp;Cannot see how  

You could feel like it will all  
Work out, we’ll crawl, if we can’t  
Walk, it’s just stupid  
Talk, don’t understand  
Why anyone would  
Take a risk on the world

## Chorus 1
**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
&emsp;Innocent boy, can’t recognize

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
Your forced disguise, your lies

**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E**  
&emsp;What is this face, staring at me

## Verse 3
**C**  
&emsp;Innocent boy

**Bb**  
&emsp;Thrust into this

**C**  
&emsp;Why’d you comply  

**Bb**  
&emsp;You wouldn’t miss  

The long years wasted on tears  
The fear to hear your lower gears  
Are just not enough  
Don’t understand  
How to keep up  
When there’s no room to stop

## Chorus 2
Innocent boy  
When did you die  
It’s been a while  
So smile  

It will be fine  
When you finally die

## Verse 4 (transitioned to minor key)
**Cm**  
&emsp;Innocent boy

**Bb**  
&emsp;Now a grown man

**G#**  
&emsp;Surrounded by hope

**Gm**  
&emsp;Imprisoned by plans

**Fm**  
&emsp;The guiding hand you wistfully spent

**G7**  
&emsp;Will break _and_ bend

## Bridge
**Cm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb**  
Late, late October

&emsp;**Eb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G#**  
I broke you the news

&emsp;**Cm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb**  
The battery’s empty

&emsp;&emsp;**Eb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G7**  
Goodbye to your views

**Cm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb**  
Late, late December

&emsp;&emsp;**Eb**&emsp;&emsp;**G#**  
The story confirmed

&emsp;**Cm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb**  
The old king is dead now

**Eb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D7**  
Long live the king

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B7**  
He won’t win

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F#7**  
Who will win, who will win

## Verse 5 (changed key)
**Bm**  
&emsp;Innocent boy

**A**  
&emsp;Burdened by rage

**G**  
&emsp;Trapped in a cage

**F#m**  
&emsp;Built from spines way too small

**Em**  
&emsp;For tasks so tall we must 
answer the call

**F#7**  
&emsp;more and more (and more and more)

I’ll stay on the floor

## Intermezzo
_Same pattern as part 1 verse, but now shortened, and slowly building towards chorus_

**Bm**&emsp;**A**&emsp;**Bm**    
**Bm**&emsp;**A**&emsp;**G6**

## Chorus 3 (same as part 1)
&emsp;**Bm**  
In meaningful mirrors, 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
in the shops, in the lakes

&emsp;**G**  
I miss seeing your face

**A**  
Unphased

**Bm**  
&emsp;Where’s the adventurer

&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
With smile ‘round the eyes

&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
I miss feeling alive

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F#7**&emsp;&emsp;**B7**  
And now I don’t __ feel like waking up anymore

## Outro
**C**  
_Slowly play the first few phrases of the main melody._
