This is the official tab for my song "Walk Awhile With You"

It's track #6 from the album ["Keeping the Sunset on my Side"](/albums/keeping-the-sunset-on-my-side/)

This song has a lot of _key changes_! It helps to play a strong _root_ note first when plucking the chords, so the transition isn't too jarring or surprising.

The chords aren't anything too fancy, but also not "standard", so here's a list:
* Am* = XXX9 10 8
* Bb = X79987
* Bbm = X79977
* Ab* = X64444X
* Gb* = X42222X
* Cdim = X3424X
* Bbdim = X12023
* Asus2 = X02200
* F#sus2 = 044200

## Intro
Dm - Am* - Gm

(@TODO: image of tab for the melody.)

## Verse
Dm  
I’d drown in your spirits,

Am&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dm (C)     
And haunted houses

Bb  
I’d walk a while with you

Gm  
Walk a while with you

## Pre-Chorus
Ab&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Eb   
Because one day soon, the world is

Bb  
Gonna change

Bbm  
And you won’t change with it

## Chorus
Ab\*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gb\*  
‘Cause you’re a classic, a timeless masterpiece

Ab\*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gb\*  
A fossil undiscovered, something I’ll always see

Cdim  
When we are 

E&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;E/Eb&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;C#m  
All waiting, waiting for the flowers

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;D&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dm  
Come home now, to make me feel 

Am  
Better

## Verse
I’d sing for you slowly  
And make you want this  
I’d walk a while with you  
All that I can do  

## Pre-Chorus
And someday soon the world is gonna change  
And you won’t change with it  

## Chorus
‘Cause you are frozen, a paragraph from books  
So old we will uncover your worth only from your looks  
But I see children, children eager to explore you  
To build something, we cannot fathom  
Yet

## Verse
I’d write out you story,  
Through fingertips and powers,  
I’d walk a while with you  
Write the end with you  

## Pre-Chorus
And someday soon the world will have changed  
And I won’t change with it  

## Chorus
I made the classic, mistake of giving up  
I made the timeless fault of wasting time on stuff  
We were all supposed to better and grow out of  

**Note!** We do not end on D - Dm - Am here! The last line is omitted, so we immediately transition into the bridge/intermezzo below.

## Intermezzo
Asus2&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;F#sus2&emsp;&emsp;Asus2  
"I’d walk a while with you ... " chants

Variations:
* Asus2\* = XX7457
* Asus2\* = XX6450
* Asus2\* = XX79 10 7

## Chorus
‘Cause we are waiting, waiting for the storm  
We are discovering we will not be born  
Again in spring, ‘cause we are out of flowers  

Cdim&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Bbdim&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dm  
Until we __ meet a __ gain
