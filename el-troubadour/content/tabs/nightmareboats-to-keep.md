These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Nightmareboats to Keep". It's the bonus track from the album ["A Ship to Something"](/albums/a-ship-to-something). 

## Notes
This is an older/alternative version of “Dreamboats to Share”. I ended up going with the other one for the album and full instrumentation.

This one felt smaller, more intimate, and more like a bonus (completely) acoustic track. A sort of twin to the other song, born from the same intro melody.

For variation, alternate between C and Csus4, and perhaps switch the F for Fmaj7
* Csus4 = X33022
* Fmaj7 = XX3213

Remark: the first line and third line of the chorus obviously sound very similar. But the first is actually extended by a few beats. If you don’t take this into account, the timing will trip you up.

## Intro
**C**&emsp;&emsp;**Csus4**

## Verse 1
**C**  
Silence again, I don’t know

**C/B**  
Why it just began, was it the

**F**  
Way I am speaking

**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Do I sound like a grandpa

## Verse 2
Lonely again, I know that  
Somewhere they have fun, is it that  
I’m always working  
Or working for an always

## Chorus 1
**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If I change what I say

&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E7**&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
You would come after me

**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
&emsp;&emsp;If I change my own ways

&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
Am I still really me?

## Verse 2
Sleeping again, dreaming of  
Ways to change the plan  
But nightmares come easily baby  
For those with great ambition  

## Chorus 2
If I change what I hate  
You would stay beside me  
But if I change my odd ways  
Am I still really me?  

## Bridge
**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
&emsp;I’ve fought a losing battle

**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
Since the day I was born

I’ve lost the fighting ammo  
I’m stuck now, tired and worn

&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
But don’t leave me hanging

**Am**&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;**C/B**  
Out to dry, I’m fine

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**  
But I still sleep alone at night

## Chorus 3
If I change dreams to play  
You would jump right to me  
But it’s my nightmare to fade  
Away what’s really me

## Outro
_“Doe doe doe doooeh” on verse melody._
