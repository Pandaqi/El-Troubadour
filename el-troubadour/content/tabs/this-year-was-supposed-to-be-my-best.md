These are the official lyrics and chords for the song ["This Year was Supposed to be my Best"](/albums/this-year-was-supposed-to-be-my-best). 

It's a Christmas single. Which means ... jazzy Christmas chords! I tried to fuse typical Christmas chords, melodies, and song structure with something more pop/rock-like. This led to the song having a bit of a weird structure, with key changes all over the place. 

For the first time, it's led by piano. (There's only some guitar strumming later to create a rhythm and a full sound.) 

I don't know yet how I should communicate piano chords here, so for now I'm afraid you'll have to look up how to play these chords yourself ...

## Verse I
**Fsus4**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C7**  
Cold nights, Starlights

**Eb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D7**  
Fireworks inside my head

**Fm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Db**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Eb**  
From now on I promise to be great instead

## Verse II
Move on, move through  
Blankets of snow, we start anew  
With the turning of years, they keep me telling me to

## Intermezzo
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**&emsp;**Edim**&emsp;**F**  
And it will come my way

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb**  
(That) It is coming my way 

To a brighter day,  
Onto brighter days

## Verse III
I should have met you by now  
My true love should have been right here  
Success, wipe out the mess, leave it in the past  

**D7**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And so I ask: 

**C7**  
Why not this year?

## Chorus I
**F**  
&emsp;&emsp;Last night I woke up screaming

**Dm**  
&emsp;&emsp;This year was supposed to be my best

**Bb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Gm**  
&emsp;It never is – it never comes around

&emsp;&emsp;**Eb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Db**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**  
To blow a soft wind, a new begin – ning or end

## Verse IV
**Dm**  
And the fireplace might burn here,

**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb**  
Christmas trees might yearn to be replaced

But the ladies with their heartbreak,  
Make these little stars shake off their grace

## Intermezzo
Will it come my way  
Is it coming my way

Do I have a say  
Do I get any say

## Pre-Chorus
**A7**  
We’re just pushing through

**C7**  
Another year, what can we do

## Chorus
Last night I woke up screaming  
This year was supposed to be my best  
It never lasts, it never stays around  
To drive me to greater and greater heights

## Bridge
**Dm**  
And I don’t ask for the world now

**C**  
I only ask for something

**A7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To hold onto closely

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Gm**  
I don’t mind me getting older

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Eb**  
But I can barely see a sign

&emsp;&emsp;**Eb/D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cm**  
I’m not just wasting time

**Cm/Bb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Ab**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And I just love the way it feels

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cm**  
When I drown again in someone’s arms

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C7**  
When horizons keep me warm

## Chorus III
Last night I woke up dreaming  
Next year is supposed to be my best  
Can I forget, oh can I turn around  
And live, all I can give, ready to begin  

## Chorus IV
Next night I want to see this  
Future that I dreamt of for a year  
Can it appear, oh will this be the time  
We’re fresh, never a mess, always my best
