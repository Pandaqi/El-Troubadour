These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "In the meadow"

It's track #5 from my album ["Is it Too Much to Ask?"](/albums/is-it-too-much-to-ask)

The only "special" chords are played in the intro. (Which also reveals that it was the last part I wrote for the song, weeks after writing the rest.) All other chords are fairly standard.

There are, however, two remarks to be made:
* The choruses have a higher tempo than the verses. (Verse = 184 BPM, Chorus = 194 BPM) Of course, there's no need to be this exact, I just think the song sounds better and more lively/aggressive when it speeds up like that.
* In the verse, there is a key switch (it happens when D -> Am -> F). I had trouble singing it at first, simply because it was unlike anything else I'd ever sung. So don't worry if you don't get it right immediately.

Chords:
* Em9 = 022002
* Cmaj13 = X32200
* D6(11) = X540005
* A7 = X02020

## Intro
**Em9**&emsp;**Cmaj13**&emsp;**D6(11)**&emsp;**A7**

## Verse 1
**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
If anyone tells you, the world isn’t yours  
**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**  
Hold your ground  
&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;**D/F#**&emsp;**Em**  
And let them hear you loud

And clear as the noises they’ll put in your head  
You are not  
A puppet or even less  

## Pre-Chorus 1
**Bm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
They will surround you  
**D/C#**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
And say it’s for your own good  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;**D/F#**   
Well let me ask you  
**B7**  
Is it feeling good?

## Chorus 1
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
Don’t stop all motion, build your explosion  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
Run away again, the world should be yours  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
And I don’t want you, to be silently put through  
&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;**D**&emsp;&emsp;**B7**  
The wasted time I lost

_(The idea is that the first C->D is drawn out with a silence in between. But the second time around it speeds up and ends on the tension-filled B7. Small variations, huge improvement.)_

## Verse 2
And if anyone tells you, listen, behave  
Hold your ground  
Though silence can be brave  

It is not my way and it shouldn’t be yours  
The fire I gave,  
Is running through your veins

## Pre-Chorus 2
You will look back one day  
And there may have been so many mistakes you can’t  
Count them, or remember, or hide them,  
But at least you made them, made them,   

## Chorus 2
Made them with purpose, made them with passion  
Stay the same my child, someday I want you to  
Come over and show me your lover  
And how you saved it all

## Solo
_Same chords as chorus._

## Chorus 3
Go fill your lungs dear, grow it so strong dear  
Even when I die, the more fires alight  
And I will meet you, here in the meadow  
And we’ll smile and laugh, and know  

## Outro 
**Em**  
We were right, we were right  
&emsp;&emsp;**C&emsp;->&emsp;D**  
Well maybe not right

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
But we were good, we were good  
&emsp;&emsp;**C&emsp;->&emsp;D**  
Well maybe not good

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
But we did our best, did our best  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C&emsp;->&emsp;D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B7**   
And we never settled for less  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
And I’m proud of that
