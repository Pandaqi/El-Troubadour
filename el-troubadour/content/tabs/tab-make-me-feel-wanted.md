This is the official tab for "Make Me Feel Wanted".

This is track #2 on the album ["Keeping the Sunset on my Side"](/albums/keeping-the-sunset-on-my-side/).

There's not really a clear verse/chorus structure. If you want, you can see this song as having three slightly different verses, or you can view the pre-chorus and chorus as one whole chorus. Either way, I've just broken the tab into smaller parts for readability's sake.

Most of these chords can be swapped for another variant at will, usually adding a 7th. The Am could be an Am7, the F can often be an Fmaj7, things like that. Have fun!


## Intro
C – Am – F – G7

## Verse
C&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Am  
This is how you drink from the ocean

F&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;C  
And I cannot go back

C&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Am  
Falling through the sighs of release

F&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;G7  
And everything we had

## Pre-Chorus
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Fmaj7&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Am  
Maybe I am fine	on my mind

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Em  
Safe and sound

F  
Somewhere in this sun, maybe I’ve begun to

Dm&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;G – G7  
Break, and no more I can take

## Verse
This is something you have to   
Understand about this news

Anything we do all I want (is) to   
bring it back to you

## Pre-Chorus
Maybe I am scared, almost there  
Unaware  
That somewhere in this void, somewhere in this void  
We run away again

## Chorus
F&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Am  
Careful and seeing

Em&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;B7  
Hearts – time will

Cmaj7&emsp;Dmaj7&emsp;G – G7  
Tear us all apart

Cause you can’t stand  
For someone else  
Time will tell you why  

## Verse
Somewhere I will fall, and I fall, and  
I cannot sing you please

Feeling like a great endeavor ‘cause   
I cannot be seen

## Pre-Chorus
With you … in my arms  
Safe and warm  
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go it’s  
Maaaaagic  
It’s magic dear

## Chorus
Cause somewhere else  
There will be someone  
Calling out, I do not know  

## Verse
This is how you make me feel wanted  
But memories will hide  
Flames will burn, the heat will be turned into  
Particles up high

## Pre-Chorus
Maybe I am fine for a time  
The stars aligned  
For that briefest time, you might just be mine  
I hope that it will burn anew

## Chorus
Cause when we land  
We will have formed our bonds  
And they are just too strong  

So when you walk  
Or maybe when I talk  
Of endings, don’t let me move on
