These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "All That I Needed to Hear (Part 2)". It's track #8 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

The ultimate climax of this album. Bits and pieces of all the other songs, but especially part 1 of course, come back here into a grand conclusion. It's required to scream "it ain't over until it's over" as loudly and emotionally as you can.

## Intro
**C** _(aggressive all downward strumming)_

## Verse 1
**C**  
In your dreams they are

**Dm**  
Flying with fire it’s 

**C**  
Something worth trying I

**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**  
Held out my hand

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
To be saved

## Chorus 1
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;**Dm**&emsp;**C**&emsp;**G**&emsp;**F**  
Got denied __

## Verse 2
You’ve been nodding and  
Reasoning seasons will  
Pass and you’ll still be the _(sped up)_ same  
Static noise, no one tuned in

## Chorus 2
I'd fight __

## Verse 3
What they’re saying it’s not  
True and I knew that I  
Slew every dragon but for  
Causes unworthy of my time  

## Chorus 3
They lied __

## Bridge 1
&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
But when I die

&emsp;&emsp;**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
The world merely shivered, the still alive

**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
&emsp;Will move on without question, a memory I’ll be

**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
&emsp;It’s a fight and the

**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Fittest they won’t miss it, but what am I

**F**&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
&emsp;If I stay in my seat and watch my life just roll

**C**&emsp;**Dm**&emsp;**C**&emsp;**G**&emsp;**F**  
By __ 

## Verse 4
So what now boy you’re  
Just gonna run from the  
World let it happen lose your  
Love, lose your soul, lose it all and

## Chorus 4
Stand by __

## Bridge 2
So when I breathe  
A weight will be lifted and I believe  
This is all that I needed to be, so don’t  

Settle down, don’t do any of that  
Nonsense you’ll surely drown  
With a teardrop in my eye, don’t see why I should  
Try __

## Intermezzo
**G** _(transitional)_

**Cadd9 -> C**  
Give me anything, anyone  
Live it anyway, anyhow

**Fmaj7**  
Burn it

No one ever regrets doing  
Something, there’s only the pain of  
Waiting and

**Am**  
Wondering

&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
Why you never dared

## Bridge 3
So when I run  
A voice screaming “listen up, here I come”  
This is all that I needed to hear, so just  

Come undone  
Leave the train, leave the station, find a new home  
Don’t you take this away, it ain’t over ‘till it’s  
Over __

## Outro
_Just slow down the strumming, until it eventually stops._

_Maybe with a sort of lullaby-like soft singing over it._

_End by playing the chorus melody over it, then the solo/intermezzo melody, then done._
