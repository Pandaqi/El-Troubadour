These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "The Way You". It's track #2 from the album ["A Ship to Something"](/albums/a-ship-to-something). 

This song has two "modes". 

The verse consists of a lot of special chords (without much repetition) that are plucked slowly, roughly following the vocal melody. The chorus consists of pretty standard chords that are continuously, very quickly fingerpicked.

And then in the bridge, it does something between those two, and switches to a different key to make that possible.

## Verse 1
**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
In my mind you’ve been floating for a while

**C/A**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bm**  
It’s brand new, it is fleeting

**C/Bb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D/F#**  
Some days, I might feel I’m oh so near

**Fmaj7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Asus2**  
And some days, I keep falling

## Pre-chorus 1
**Em** **D/F#** **G**&emsp;**Am** **C/B**  
Deal the cards just right

**Em**&emsp;&emsp;**D/F#** **Fmaj7**&emsp;**B7**  
Keep up hope, by my side

## Chorus 1
&emsp;**C**  
I love the way you hold your arms

&emsp;**D**  
Around yourself to keep you warm

&emsp;**G**  
But end up running anyway

**D/F#**&emsp;**Em**  
&emsp;&emsp;Into my safe arms just to stay

And I’d love the way you’d cheer me up  
When nothing works and I get stuck  
Inside my head with problems I can’t  
&emsp;&emsp;Find my way without your hands

## Post-Chorus 1
&emsp;&emsp;**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bm**  
But I know it'll be time for me to go

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B7**  
When you see my shoulder hanging low

**Cmaj7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Fmaj7** (repeat)  
Oh __

## Verse 2
I can’t work a miracle or dream  
In fact, it’s hard to work at all  
My flesh is as good as I preserve it  
And my mind needs your patience

## Pre-Chorus 2
Hand me faith, I'll too  
Throw away the checklist, bury it for you

## Chorus 2
And I love the way you sing my songs  
And even with the words all wrong  
Any melody from you will  
Give me strength to write ten new

And I love the way you’d drag me from  
The endless work and beating drum  
Of hesitation and ambition  
Brewed into a money cocktail

## Post-Chorus 2
&emsp;&emsp;**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bm**  
That knows the only time for me to go  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C#7**  
Was when I saw your shoulders hanging low

## Bridge (key change)
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F#m**&emsp;&emsp;**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
And as I age the list grows longer  
‘Till no puzzle piece will fit at all

**(A/G#)** **F#m**&emsp;&emsp;**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
It’s not fair to expect all this from someone

**(A/G#)** **F#m**&emsp;&emsp;**D**&emsp;**E**  
But god dang it I will try

## Chorus 3 (change back)
But I would love the way you drink your tea  
Or fold your towels, stand by me  
When sunrise turns into sunset  
Some children running ‘round our head

And I’d love the mess you leave behind  
If space and time would be so kind  
To tangle us and intertwine  
Two lives that just might coincide

## Post-Chorus 3
And the truth is I'd let it all just go  
If it turns out you’re nothing like this song

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C/B**  
And all we do is move on

**Bb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G#**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Move along
	
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F#m**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B7**  
Move along __

## Outro
_The verse pluckings, but played more like a solo/outro._
