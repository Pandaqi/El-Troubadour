These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Don't Forget Me". It's track #1 (and the _title track_) from the album ["Don't Forget Me"](/albums/dont-forget-me).

Simple chords. Very drawn out. The droning "don't forget me" in the background is obviously there in the song, but it works just as well with just piano backing.

## Verse 1
**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**  
Would you __ come outside

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
See the beauti __ ful late late summer sky

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
(And) It’s all for __ you

## Verse 2
Would you __ give me time  
A long look to __ see my soul and my desire  
(And) it’s all for __ you

## Chorus 1
**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**  
Lately __ fire in my veins

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
I need that “maybe”

&emsp;&emsp;**G7**  
If it’s not too late

_(constant downward phrase, no strict melody)_  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C/B**  
Just don’t forget me, don’t forget me,  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**  
don't forget me, don’t forget me, don’t forget me

## Verse 3
Would you __ give me days  
To find patien __ ce to work hard and to create  
All I have to __ do

## Verse 4
And would you __ give me strength  
To survive all __ that might one day be my end  
I’m not ready __ to

## Chorus 2
Give up __ my name and my ideas  
I need to live up  
To potential dear  

Just don’t forget me, don’t forget me,   
don’t forget me, don’t forget me, don’t forget me

## Intermezzo
_Build up to the bridge_

## Bridge
**G**  
&emsp;Each day 

**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**  
&emsp;I’m falling forward

**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E**  
&emsp;And falling for

&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
The emptiness in dreams

&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C/B**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
That builds, and builds, and builds, 

&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**  
'til I’m just a speck

Of dust and bones  
Could I be more  
Than a live lived in forgetfulness  
That tries, and tries, and tried,  
but one day just died

## Chorus 3
Frightened to leave nothing behind  
So when the lights turn (off)  
Will you be so kind  
To not forget me, don’t forget me, don’t forget me,  
don’t forget me, don’t forget me

## Outro
_Soft and sweet melody on piano_.
