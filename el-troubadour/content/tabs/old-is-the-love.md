These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Old is the Love". It's track #5 from the album ["A Ship to Something"](/albums/a-ship-to-something). 

This song is relatively short and simple. Don't make it bigger than it is, just some soft plucking and singing will make it amazing :) At the same time, it uses quite some odd chords (which go out of key as well), so be sure to check them out if you don't know how to play them.
