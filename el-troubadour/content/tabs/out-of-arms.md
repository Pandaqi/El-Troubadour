These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Out Of Arms". It's track #3 from the album ["Don't Forget Me"](/albums/dont-forget-me).

One of my rare happy, lighthearted, jumpy songs. Really, throw some voice cracks and odd rhythms in there and you're good to go.

There are three very distinct parts with other rhythms/melodies: verse, chorus and bridge. That's because this used to be three separate ideas that I discovered worked well together.

While we're in a good mood, I just wanted to draw your attention to my clever wordplay, with "out of arms" also being a metaphor for hugging someone (as it puts you out of arms to use). In case you were wondering.

## Verse 1
**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**  
Sunny days were never quite so __ bright

**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
Snowy days were never such ex __ traordinary sights

**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb**  
&emsp;And my heart said: “Let us live, let us live”

&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Gm**  
Don’t hide now, don’t put up your walls

&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
Don’t fasten your armor because

## Chorus 1
**G**  
I like the way that it

**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
Hurts and it burns yet I cannot let go

**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**  
&emsp;&emsp;I like the fear you leave for being alone

&emsp;&emsp;**Bb**  
I’d drink all your poison,

&emsp;&emsp;**F**  
Give keys to my guard

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dsus4** **D**  
Because I’m out of arms

## Verse 2
Early mornings never felt so __ right  
Late night talks were never such long __ lasting delights  
And your voice sang: “Let us live, let us live”  
Don’t lie down, don’t bury your head  
In the problems of tomorrow instead  

## Chorus 2
I like the way that it  
Stings and it brings me a heartache or two  
I like the time wasted being with you  
I’d jump from the mountains  
Naked into harm  
Because I’m out of arms  

**Dsus4**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It’s not giving up

&emsp;&emsp;**G7**  
If I choose to leave the door open

## Bridge (part A)
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
So say goodbye to classes and tables

**Am**  
Hi to the mess that we made of 

**Em**&emsp;&emsp;**(E7)** **A7**  
Life, to every injury of

**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
Faith, believe me I’d hate 

## Bridge (part B)
&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
To be endlessly safe here but lonely

**Em**  
Guarding secrets that only

**F**  
Me

&emsp;**Am** -> **G** -> **F** -> **Em**  
And no one around

**Am**&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;**G7**  
Cares about, what do you care about?

## Chorus 3
That I like being  
Afraid and too late, if your arms keep me safe  
I’d love a teardrop if the answer you gave  
Was love and tender kisses  
A soft word and warmth  
Put me out of arms

**Dsus4**&emsp;**D**&emsp;&emsp;**G7**  
Put me out of arms

## Verse 3 (modified; cut short)
Frankly dear I never felt this __ shine  
Got no fear and no regret I'm __ drawing no more lines  
And I'll scream now: “Let us live, let us live”  

**C**  
Let us live, let us live

**G7**  
Let us live __
