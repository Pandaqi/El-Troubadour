These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Could I Be Happy Here". It's track #2 from the album ["Don't Forget Me"](/albums/dont-forget-me).

This is _not_ an easy song! Both to play and to sing. There are multiple key changes, the guitar rhythm is important (and changes), and there's even a dramatic pause or two in the chorus.

I think it's best to stay loose and just let the energy take it. This song requires high energy, danceable, upbeat, scream it with everything you have. That's the only way it works. And if you do that, playing the right chords or singing the right notes doesn't matter that much :p

## Verse 1
**C**  
Go, go, go

&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
Yet so far __ to go

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**  
You’re done playing child, being young and wild, build a home

&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;**C/B**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
Well maybe I will let you know know know

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
But for now I’m reaching for

## Verse 2
Gold, gold, gold  
Put the choi __ ces on hold  
I’m done playing child, want to live my life, make it work  
Well maybe I will see the world world world  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E7**&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
But it all means nothing girl

## Chorus 1
&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
Could I be __ happy here

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F** &emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
Could I be glad __ that I was where I was supposed to be

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**  
Could a summer day help me to stay

&emsp;**Eb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cmaj7**  
And luck hides there who knows

**Db7**  
&emsp;Well anyway

## Post-Chorus 1
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
Cause today __ anything goes

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**&emsp;&emsp;**E**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F#m**  
And today the summer breeze  
Will blow my

**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
Way __

**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;**(G7)**  
Way

## Verse 3
And we sleep sleep sleep  
On what we really _ believe  
We let them tell us to work hard and study our youth  
Then we’re older and it’s all a show show show  

&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;**B7** _(or Am -> B7 ->)_  
It was all for nothing girl

## Verse 4
And then I see see see  
Happy couples _ with dreams  
A job they hate, and a bill to pay, but they’re free  
Stick together and soon bend the knee knee knee  
Now it’s all or nothing girl

## Chorus 2
Could I be happy here  
Could I be glad that I was where I was supposed to be  
Could wisdom come with years to come  

&emsp;**Eb**&emsp;&emsp;**Bb**&emsp;&emsp;**Dbmaj7** _(raised key one semitone)_  
And let me see the truth

**D7**  
&emsp;Well anyway

## Post-Chorus 2 (still raised key)
&emsp;**Eb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb**  
Today anything goes

&emsp;**Eb**&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Gm**  
Today the summer breeze will blow my

**Eb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb** _(repeat)_  
Way __

&emsp;**F**  
I’m holding on, I’m holding on,

&emsp;**G7** _(back to original key)_  
But out of place I’m not that strong

## Verse 5
So I grow grow grow  
Cause I have __ to know  
Is my purpose just to make money or is to plant?  
I’m yelling at all of our gods gods gods  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B7**  
But they just can’t pay __ the rent

## Bridge
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**  
We keep falling on our only hope

&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;**(G/Ab)**  
We drink the drug then we die alone

&emsp;&emsp;**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**  
And I __ am defeated 

&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
And I barely even care

We keep trying to figure this out  
We follow rules then die without  
A sli __ ver of certainty  
(I) Was supposed to be there

## Post-Chorus 3 (changed key)
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
Cause today __ anything goes

&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
Today the summer breeze will blow my

**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C** _(repeat until fade)_  
Way __
