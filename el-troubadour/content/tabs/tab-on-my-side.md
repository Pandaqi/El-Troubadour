This is the official tab for my song "On My Side".

It's track #7 from the album ["Keeping the Sunset on my Side"](/albums/keeping-the-sunset-on-my-side/).

This song has some very weird chords! However, once you've seen them a few times, they aren't that hard, and you'll also notice the patterns. 

(For example, the verse chords are just the same shape moving up and down the fret. Literally. Place your finger in a line, such that you barre the lower four strings, and move it up/down and you're 90% there.)

Here's the list of chords:
* **E6sus9** = XX2222
* **A6sus9** = XX7777
* **F6sus9** = XX3333
* **Fsus\*(b6, add9)** = XX3323
* **A6sus** = X X 7 7 7 10
* **A#dim(b6)** = X X 8 9 7 9
* **B\*** = X X 9 8 7 7
* **G6sus9** = XX5555
* **D6(11)** = XX0002
* **D6(11)/C** = X3002

## Intro
E6sus9 – A6sus9 – Fsus* – F6sus9

## Verse 
**E6sus9**&emsp;**A6sus9**&emsp;**Fsus\***&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F6sus9**  
Finders keepers, when the doubt erases everything we do  
Finders keepers, when I’m slowly sleeping afraid of waking up  

## Pre-Chorus
**E6sus9** (move higher and higher on the high E-string)  
So eyes open, I turn away

## Chorus
**A6sus**  
It’s shaping up to be a

**A#dim(b6)**   
Cloudy day

**B\***&emsp;&emsp;**G6sus9**  
But my heart is

**F6sus9**  
Slowly

**E6sus9**  
Taunted

**D6(11)**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D6(11)/C**  
Back

## Verse
Finders keepers, when I store my spirit closely guarded in it  
Finders keepers, if I don’t remember, the ghost is lost forever

## Pre-Chorus
You see, no luck on my side

## Chorus
**Note!** On the third phrase ("... might softly") I extend the same chord for one extra bar. I don't know why I did that, but it ended up being in the song, so I rolled with it.

It’s shaping up to be a  
Cloudy day  
But the rain might softly  
Wash clean  
The scene  
Here  

## Intermezzo
Bit of plucking/improv on D6(11) -> D6(11)/C

## Verse
Find me sleeping, wake me up already, if you think I’m ready  
Guide me, steep blur, a foggy future fails me, but nothing else will pay me

## Pre-Chorus
Please just make a choice

## Chorus
**Note!** After "busy day", we do _not_ get a short pause/breather before going to the next section (like in the previous choruses).

It’s shaping up to be a  
Busy day   
With my head still   
Burning  
Churning  
Possibilities  

## Outro
The chorus is softly plucked one last time, just because I like it.

Then, from that D6(11)/C, gradually move towards a regular C. (For example, via a chord with a C# in the bass.)

Why? So we can flow into the last section ... 

## Post-Song
**Note!** This is simply the very first part of this album, repeated here because of artistic reasons. (It makes the album cohesive, thematic and nicely closes it out.)

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
I’ve been calling out, but nobody’s there

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
I’m keeping the sunset on my side

I’ve been resting here, but there’s no repair  
I’m keeping the sunset on my side

I’ve found crushing souls, but no room to spare  
So guess what? The sunset stays on my side
