This is the official tab for my song "The Mighty King Still Runs".

It's track #5 from the album ["Keeping the Sunset on my Side"](/albums/keeping-the-sunset-on-my-side/)

Yes, the song starts on a _very short_ chorus. The names "chorus" and "verse" don't really matter here: I just needed a way to differntiate these two distinct sections. And, at first, this song had a short introductory verse, but I removed it.

(Fun fact: this used to be track #4 of the album. But then I realized that track #6 and track #7 had almost identical tempo and strumming patterns, which was boring and confusing, so I wanted to break them apart, and ended up moving track #6 before this one.)

**Notes**
* This song has a Capo on the 3rd fret
* **D/F#** = 200232
* **A/C#** = X4222X
* **B/D#** = X6444X

## Chorus
I like to play the melody with the chords. (So add or emphasize the notes E3 - E0 - B3 - D2 to the chords, respectively.)

**Em**&emsp;**D/F#**&emsp;**G**&emsp;**C**  
Re __ vo __ lu __ tions

## Verse
**Bm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
Somewhere in the dark,

**Bm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
The mighty king still runs

**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**(D/F#)** **Em**  
Somewhere in the shadows

&emsp;&emsp;**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;**(C/B)**  
He is sticking to his guns

**Am**&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Careful now

**F**  
When you rise above,

**F**  
When you rise above the ground the world will 

**G**  
Follow

## Chorus
I can’t wait here

## Verse
For just a little while, just a little longer  
We can sing till we’re weary and remember a time  
When someone will  
Rise above,  
Rise above the crowd and they will follow  

## Chorus
Silent poison

## Verse
Running through his veins  
A black spot on his reign  
From the outer windows  
His condition may seem faint  
But you don’t know  
When you rise above,   
When you rise above the fold, the world will  
Swallow (you whole)

## Bridge
**Bm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
He was waiting on someone to rescue him

**A/C#**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**(A)**&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
To tell him it’s okay, to waste away by the fire

He was waiting on someone to cheer him on  
To tell him oh you can hide or be the fire

He begged forgiveness from, his people, children, anyone  
The man he should become was not a king to anyone  

**B/D#**  
And on his knees, he pleads, he grieves

**B/D#**  
He means to make you see oh

## Chorus
Please believe me

## Verse
Somewhere in the dark  
The mighty king still runs  
Somewhere in the shadows  
He is sticking to his guns  
Carefully waiting  
He will rise above  
He will rise above the clouds, yes he will come home
