These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "You never will, I never won't". It's track #1 from the album ["A Ship to Something"](/albums/a-ship-to-something). 

The song has a lot of key changes and tempo ( = strumming pattern) changes.

Most notably the bridges: bridge 1 has the same general tempo as the verse/chorus, but slows down considerably, and changes key. Bridge 2 changes to a whole different tempo and strumming pattern, much slower. Then it speeds up again, so we end on the last chorus.

A few listens to the song will clear this up, although it might take a few tries to get all parts correct and flowing into each other.

Besides that, the chords itself aren't that special, and the melody and plucking is pretty consistent (albeit fast).

## Verse 1
**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
I’ve been turning, waking, restless

**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
About the way the world should be

**C/B**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**  
Can’t forget you just would not agree

**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E7**  
You never saw, I always see

## Verse 2
I wish some time machine could save me  
From old mistakes you don’t believe  
Can’t forget this was not what I planned  
You never can, I never can’t

## Chorus 1
**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;**C/B**  
See ____ me as I

**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;**C/B**  
Plead __ down on my

**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;**E7**  
Knees, if I could’ve been __ anyone else

**C7**  
If you had left the chain

**Fm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D#**&emsp;**Fm**&emsp;&emsp;**D#**  
Give me a day, believe me I’ll

**E**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Asus2**&emsp;**(… -> Am)**  
Fly ___

## Verse 3
It never even came to heartbreak  
By then the brain cells were all numb  
Endless searching, I never came home  
You never will, I never won’t

## Verse 4 
_(go higher, loosen the actual melody)_  
And now I’m running from the answers  
I do not like them they’re not __ me  
Raised by monsters, how can you grow free?  
You’ll never die, I’ll never be

## Chorus 2
Hear __ me as I  
Scream __ split at the  
Seams, I can’t bleed anymore

The hurt that used to burn  
Has turned to ice  
One more push and I’ll die

## Bridge 1
**B**  
Oh I’ll

**E**  
Die – the prospect of not making it

**D**  
Out alive flashes by – and it

**E**  
Scares me, what I will never do, what I will never make

**D**  
Twenty wasted years, what is twenty more?

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
You won’t expect it, that’s the best part, it is proving you were

&emsp;&emsp;**E**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
Wrong dear, that’s the best part, it is proving you were

&emsp;&emsp;**E**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B7**  
Wrong dear, admit it, you never will, I never won’t

## Bridge 2
_Strumming => bam BAM BAM => low HIGH HIGH_  
_Start half tempo => slowly speed up_

**E**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E**  
Oeh __

&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E**  
Only one feeling left, use it well

Oeh __  
Got something to prove, nothing to lose

Oeh __  
A goal is a goal, let it go

Oeh __  
Pester the gods with your stubbornness

Oeh __  
Don’t need to be right, I have

## Chorus 3/Outro
_Similar to other choruses, just shifted in key_

**E**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G#m**&emsp;**F#m**&emsp;**E**  
Time __ right on my side  
Why turn unstoppable tides

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
You will never love me back like that

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
You will never give me back what I had

**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;**D**  
&emsp;&emsp;You never will, I never

**E**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A** _(exact same ending as normal chorus)_  
Won’t __

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E**  
Feel that way again
