This is the official tab for my song "Don't Pretend"

It's track #4 on the album ["Keeping the Sunset on my Side"](/albums/keeping-the-sunset-on-my-side/)

It uses many chords you wouldn't typically see in songs, which is why I provided a nice chord list here:
* Bmaj7 = X24342
* Emaj7 = X79797
* Dmaj7 = X57675
* Amaj7 = 002120
* Emaj7* = 024100
* Bsus2 = X24400

When I say "D variations", I mean that I walk up the high E-string (playing frets 2, 4, 5) for a nice transition.

Also, I probably mislabeled some of those chords. (I'm not an expert in naming chords.) If so, let me know.

## Intro
Bmaj7 - Emaj7 - Dmaj7 - Amaj7 - D/A

## Verse
Bmaj7&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Emaj7  
Don’t pretend you don’t know the words

&emsp;&emsp;Bmaj7&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Emaj7  
To your favourite song, and you don’t wanna dance

&emsp;&emsp;Dmaj7&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Amaj7&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;D/A (+variations)  
It’s the moves, it’s the moves, that you make

Don’t pretend there is no one else  
You would rather see, be or live without  
It’s the choice, it’s the choice, that you make  

## Chorus
Emaj7\*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Bsus2  
It’s all in your mind again

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;C#m  
Trying to save face

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;E&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Amaj7  
But it’s a lonely horse betting on this race

If the mask you’re wearing is not  
Made of something happy why would  
You stick out your tongue again  
What’s taking so long my friend

## Verse
Don’t pretend you don’t lie awake  
Every night in bed worries overtake  
That your future, your future, is not what you made  

Don’t pretend you don’t like the taste  
Of something unhealthy, or you think it’s a waste  
To spend time, precious time, buried in the glass  

## Chorus
It’s all in your mind again  
When you’re going under  
Cover in your own estate with your covers raised  

There is an awkward space for the  
Mind to roam free and embrace  
That you’re the lonely horse betting on this race  

## Outro
(Just switch between Bmaj7 and Emaj7, with the occasional Dmaj7 of Amaj7 thrown in, until the song completely fades out, or you've had enough of it.)

Don’t pretend  
Just don’t pretend
…
