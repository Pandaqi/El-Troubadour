These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Don't Give Me Up". It's track #1 from the album ["Don't Give Me Up"](/albums/dont-give-me-up). 

This is a really short, simple song. The piano basically follows the melody, but that happens automatically by playing these chords with both hands. It's one of the earliest songs I ever wrote, so the accompaniment isn't that sophisticated.

## Intro
F – Am/F – F  
F – F/Bb - F

## Verse I
**F**&emsp;**Am/F**&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F/Bb** **F**  
I’ve left you&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;it’s done now

**F**&emsp;**Am/F**&emsp;**F**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F/Bb** **F**  
They’ll catch me&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;don’t hold me up

**Dm**&emsp;**Dsus2**&emsp;**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;**C/F**   
&emsp;I’m falling&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;in the arms of law

**Bbdim**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**  
&emsp;&emsp;I’ll accept it&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;when there’s no way out

## Verse II
I’m sleeping        it’s tiring   
They’ll follow    don’t wake me up  
I know it	some deeds are not done  
Just go and        love another one  

**Cmaj7**  
Now that I’m really gone

## Verse III
I’m running      you know why  
They’ll call you    don’t give me up  
I promise        not to leave again  
I know now    where this sentence ends

As they handcuff my hands
