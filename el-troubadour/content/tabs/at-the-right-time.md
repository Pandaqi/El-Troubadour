These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "At the right time". It's track #1 from the album ["Feast your Eyes on Me"](/albums/feast-your-eyes-on-me). 

Most of this song is just a few basic chords … but plucked on just 3 strings (D,G,B), which automatically makes them sound more unique and open. 

The bridge(s) do more special stuff, but still with the same idea. (Pretty standard chords, but in a different voicing, and only plucking the middle strings of the guitar.)

Chords:
* G = XX5400
* D = XX4200
* Em = XX2000
* Am = XX7500
* Fm = XX3200 (the D, but with the lowest note a half tone lowered)
* C = XX10 9 00
* G\* = XX9780
* Asus2 = XX79 10 0

The _second_ bridge has some unique chords that might seem overwhelming, so I made a separate list:
* Bm7/G = XX978 10
* Am7/E = XX7987
* Gmaj7 = XX5770 => XX5750 (transition halfway)
* Dsus2 = XX0220 => XX0222 (quick hammer-on halfway)

## Verse 1
**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
I spoke to a God today

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;**D**&emsp;**Em**  
And he was weeping softly

**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
&emsp;&emsp;About the humans trapped in rage

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Fm**  
Trapped in their golden cage

## Verse 2
I spoke with a God today  
And he was weeping slowly  
About the way the world should be  
And he mourned us

## Chorus 1
**G**  
What if the world stops spinning  
What if the oceans rise and

**D**  
I’m left wondering

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
About the way it all went down

&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Did I fight back at the right time

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Did I speak up just enough

## Verse 3
I spoke with our God today  
And he was cursing sadly  
The state of affairs in the world out there  
And everything could have been better  

## Chorus 2
What if the world stops spinning  
What if the oceans rise and  
I’m left wondering

_(slightly sped up)_  
Did I do the sane thing  
Did I do the right things at the right time  
Did I say the right things to the  

## Bridge (type 1)
**G\***  
Lost souls and their

**Asus2**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
&emsp;&emsp;Lost souls enter the fray

## Verse 4
I spoke with your God today  
And he was leaving surely  
For all the humans trapped in guilt  
Would never rebuild this  

## Chorus 3
World that will keep on spinning  
We’ll let the oceans rise  
And I’m left wondering  
Was it worth the fake sense of joy  
Was it worth it to sleep softly  
Was it worth it just enough  

## Bridge (type 2)
&emsp;**Bm7/G**&emsp;&emsp;**Am7/E**  
I’ll kneeeel before death’s door

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Gmaj7**  
One day, sailing for the liiiighthouse

**Dsus2**  
&emsp;But we will never, we will never reach the shore ...

... sure-ly there’s a plan  
But what, role will I play there  
Many drops make a waterfall  

**Dsus2**  
&emsp;Sparks of hope make the mighty monarchs fall

## Solo
I don't know, I improvised this.

## Outro
_(only lightly sung, on top of intro pattern)_  
Did I do everything I could?  
Did I speak up at the right time?  
Did I fight back just enough?
