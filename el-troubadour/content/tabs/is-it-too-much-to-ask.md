These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Is it too much to ask?"

It's track #3 from my album ["Is it Too Much to Ask?"](/albums/is-it-too-much-to-ask)

The whole song is very small and simple, with just a plucked guitar and a voice for the most part. It only ramps up at the very end, with actual chords (and multiple parts) being played. The chords are pretty standard, with the exception of some dominant 7 or diminished chords thrown in.

There is no predefined "plucking pattern" for this song, although I recommend starting simple, but increasing complexity as the song progresses. (This creates variety and a sense of "progression" in the song. Otherwise, each verse will sound exactly the same, just with different words.)

Lastly, the tempo speeds up in the chorus (Verse = 138 BPM, Chorus = 148 BPM). That's how I recorded the original demo for the song, and that's how I think it sounds best. Keeping the tempo steady might be a smoother transition (from verse to chorus), but just doesn't sound or feel great to me.
