These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "I Miss Seeing Your Face (Part 1)". It's track #3 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

This song is less angry than the other songs, more melancholic/sad. Also the chorus has exceptionally high notes to sing (sorry, my vocal range is weird for a man), but I'm not sure if changing it will keep the energy of the song ...

&emsp;I will never be your lonesome guard

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D/C#**&emsp;&emsp;**Bm**  
Never be the hero in your stone heart

**(A)**&emsp;&emsp;**G6**

I will never be your horseback prince  
Never be the savior that holds back sins

**A** _(or F#7)_

## Chorus 1
&emsp;&emsp;**Bm**  
If you let me outside

&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
I will meet you alive

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
Cause I miss seeing your face

**A**  
Always

Could be forever but  
Forever is long  
To miss seeing your face  
Now I  

**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F#7**  
Don’t __ feel like waking up anymore

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bm**  
Now I’m on the floor

## Verse 2
I will never be the richest friend  
Never be the trend that stays ‘till the end  
I’m not ma __ gic  

I will never go where no man’s gone before  
Never lead you to the flower covered courts  
I am sta __ tic  

## Chorus 2
Let’s pretend we’re still young  
We’re scared kids holding on  
And I miss seeing your face  
For days

Could be a classroom,   
Or a carefree Sunday,  
I miss going away  

Now I  
Don’t __ feel like waking up anymore  
Now I’m on the floor

## Intermezzo
**Bm**&emsp;**D**&emsp;**G**&emsp;**Em -> F#7** _(repeat)_

_Wilder and wilder, more aggressive, “climax”, until it settles down back to the bridge_

## Bridge
_This is basically the verse from part 2, but inverted, with some variations, and of course with the rhythm/tempo of this song._

**Bm**  
Innocent boy

**A**  
Tried oh so hard

**G**  
To keep you so close

**A**  
And share my old heart

**Bm**  
And they say that every 

**A**  
Minute spent on regret and mistakes 

**G**  
Will come to pass

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F#7**  
This too shall pass

## Chorus 3
In the quiet sad moments  
In the nights of disgrace  
I miss seeing your face  
Erased

Can’t find the words to  
Tell you how much it weighs  
On me _(sped up)_, I just picture your face

Now I  
Don’t __ feel like waking up anymore  
Now I’m on the floor

## Bridge 2
Innocent boy  
Done nothing wrong  
Bad place bad time  
To be there alone

And they say  
That nothing’s permanent  
And those smiles, and the hands, and the jokes,  
And the plans, and the love, and the friends,  
Will surely pass  
This too shall pass

## Outro
_(Same as verse)_

I will never be the young boy again  
The Peter Pan with the grand sentiment  
I am ol __ der  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F#7**  
And you are col __ der
