These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Careful Not to Dream (Part 1)". It's track #2 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

Guitar strumming just _up/down/up/down_ all the way through. The timing on some words is a bit tricky, but you'll figure it out. Otherwise, as with the whole album, angry singing required.

## Chords

## Intro
**Am7**&emsp;&emsp;**C/G**&emsp;&emsp;**C/F**

## Verse 1
**Am7**  
Anything I

**C/G**  
Own, made it on my

**C/F**  
Own, but gone

Careful not to  
Dream there’s miles hidden be-  
Tween your goals

## Chorus 1
**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
Wasted all these years, trying to

**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E**  
Find what was rightfully mine

**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
Wasted all this time, trying to fly __

## Verse 2 (key raised) 
**Bm**  
Anything I

**A**  
Know, learnt it on my

**G**  
Own with no

**F#7**  
Rest at all, I was


Careful not to  
Dream, the world’s not as it  
Seems and so  
Best not call on the

**E**  
Gods __ to help you out

## Chorus 2 (same as chorus 1)
Wasted all these years  
Trying to fight what  
Was never my foe

Wasted my reserves  
On empty  
Words

## Bridge
_Stop strumming, just one-time chords. More dreamy. Slower._

**Bm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cmaj7**  
But what if	somehow

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Gsus2**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E**  
It’s all possible and it’s real

&emsp;&emsp;**C#m**&emsp;&emsp;**B**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
Would I be the fool who throws it away

**Bm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cmaj7**   
But what if dreams of old

**Dmaj7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cmaj7**  
&emsp;Were strong enough to change the world

**Gsus2**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E**  
And I am the messenger

&emsp;&emsp;**C#m**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
Then why are they all yelling I’m in the wrong

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Asus2/F#**  
Should I just play along

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am/E**  
It’s all in my head

## Verse 4 / Outro
_Same chords as other verses. But the last line of the melody is just a held note. And it reverses the melody near the end._

Anything I own  
Built it from the stones

Anything I loved  
Had to let it go

Anything I dreamt  
Buried in the land

Careful not to dream  
You don’t know what you mean

_Keep playing the chords until fade_
