These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Short Jumping". It's track #4 from the album ["Feast your Eyes on Me"](/albums/feast-your-eyes-on-me). 

An upbeat, uptempo song with many opportunities for some decorative flair in your guitar playing! 

I'm afraid I improvised the solo parts, so below are only the _chords_. I'll try to write down what I did in the future so I can add it to my tabs.

Special chords:
* Adim = X01212
* Bb7 = X13111
* C7 = X35333
* D7 = X57575 _(or just XX0212)_

## Intro
A series of different G-chord variations: 
* 302000 => 304000 => 305000 (or reverse)
* 300200 => 300400 => 300500 (or reverse)

When you're ready to start the song, end on an open A: 5000XX

## Verse 1
**G**  
I wonder what it’s like to live

**C**  
Out in the woods – and send the letters

Greet nature morning and evening we  
Live off the land – forget the

## Chorus 1
**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D7**  
Worries made by

**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G7**  
Society and gates

**C**  
Built out of spite

**Bb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**  
&emsp;We would say goodbye

**Bb7**  
&emsp;To money and schools

**C7**  
&emsp;A life we can’t choose

**D7**  
&emsp;Wouldn’t it be good

## Verse 2
I wonder what it’s like to  
Rewrite all our youths – and learn the letters  

Play forward, scars are just warnings  
To repeat mistakes – the once we made when we  

## Chorus 2
Danced to a drum  
Not yet so strung, humming the simple hum  
That made our voice strong  
Back where we belong

Our nature, our life  
Our strongest inner desires  
To reignite the fire  

## Intermezzo
**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cadd9** _(several times)_  
**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D7**

## Bridge
**G**  
&emsp;&emsp;I’ve been living in the moment

**C**  
&emsp;&emsp;I’ve been living for the dream

**G**  
&emsp;&emsp;I have lists and lists of futures

**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D7**  
&emsp;&emsp;None picking up steam

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**  
Come close

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
Stay safe – make way

**Adim**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**  
&emsp;&emsp;Don’t be smart it’s just a short jump

## Verse 5
We’re taking, taking heartache  
And building it back  
Better  than it ever was

Can’t wait to come home  
And smell fresh air again  
And build a bower  

## Solo
Same as intermezzo, but ending on **G7**

_Most importantly: go loose, be merry, play some cool riffs, follow the groove as long as you like! That's what I did._

## Post   
_(slower tempo, completely different vibe/melody)_

&emsp;**Em**&emsp;&emsp;**D/F#**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
We are the world, but we forgot we don’t own it  
We’re scared for the jump, but our legs will support us  
We rose from the dirt, not to rush and not to hurt  
Not to study or to work, I wonder, I wonder

## Outro
_Repeat the bridge cadence, fading out_
