## Verse 1
**Bb\***  
&emsp;It’s no problem

**Bb\*/A**  
&emsp;It’s all fine, it’s quite alright

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb\*/G**  
They will understand I mean it well

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb\*/C**  
Given some time

## Verse 2
Just a white lie  
Truth withheld, means to an end  
Need a problem solved, a helping hand  
So draw the line

## Pre-Chorus 1
**F\***  
Again again again again again

**F\*/E**  
The same

**F\***  
Fault in our

**Dm**  
Brains

## Chorus 1
**C**  
We dance, we lie, we break  
We do this all a thousand times

**C/B**  
Explain it all away – the  
Misleading words spit from our mouths we

**Bb\***  
Keep our wrongs at bay

**Bb\*/A**  
But it’s not okay

**Dm\***  
A small leak will grow, a mistake will sow 

**Bb\*/C**&emsp;&emsp;**C/B**&emsp;&emsp;**Bb\*/A**  
Pebbles in rivers __  

**Bb\*/G**  
Soon rock the world with their waves

## Intermezzo
_Same as intro._

## Verse 3
Why not start now  
Why not take the first step leading there  
Every day a stone to stack and stall  
Soon builds a wall

## Verse 4
Get the rivers flowing  
Even subtle streams are always going  
To a common goal a larger whole  
Without the need for greed to push underneath

## Pre-Chorus 2
Again again again again again  
You can _  
Choose to be more

## Chorus 2
We hide, we steal, we crave  
We do this all a thousands times, we  

Seal our hearts away – the  
Lives ruined to keep dignity, we

Only look ahead  
At most a day

But a seed will grow, even small stars they glow  
Pebbles in rivers __  
Soon overflow our brick walls and they cannot be stopped

## Intermezzo (repeat 4x)
**Dm\***&emsp;&emsp;**Bb\*/A**&emsp;&emsp;**Bb\***  
Oeh __

## Bridge 1
**Dm\***&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb\*/A**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb\***  
Remember days when we would share a bed  
Whenever we were cold

Remember weeks when we just did not speak  
For reasons that we lost

Remember months when you’d raise me up  
When I just could not hold

**Dm\***&emsp;**Bb\*/A**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb\***  
Onto something and keep flowing along

&emsp;&emsp;**Bb\*/A**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb\*/G**  
Every day a little harder

## Bridge 2 (higher voice)
Remember every time you’d tell me off  
For something that’s not wrong

Remember every lecture lacking love  
When I just wanted hope

Remember ever present need to shine  
Any step would’ve been fine

How could you wonder what made me what I am  
Every day a little cruel

## Chorus 3
We sleep, we dream, we wake  
We do this all a thousand times, each

Day a brand new slate – to be  
Thankful, fearful, or cower and wait

Don’t let the moment pass  
Make them all last

Small step's a jump, ev'ry creation a bump  
Pebbles in rivers __  
Can somehow lead to an architecture to behold

## Intermezzo
Oeh __

## Outro
_Ad-lib singing on bridge melody_
