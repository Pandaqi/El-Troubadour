Below are my official tabs for the song "Keeping the Sunset"

This is track #1 from the album ["Keeping the Sunset on my Side"](/albums/keeping-the-sunset-on-my-side/).

As usual, I suspect basic chords are known (or can be Googled), and leave room for improvisation.

## Intro
C&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;F&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;C  
I’ve been calling out, but there’s no one there

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;F&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;C  
I’m keeping the sunset on my side

I’ve been trying hard, but it’s beyond repair  
Keeping the sunset on my side

I’ve been touching souls, but nobody cares  
Still keeping the sunset on my side

## Intermezzo
Do fun stuff with C variations, until we end on Cm

## Verse
Notes:
* Quickly riff on the low notes before switching chords! (Do whatever sounds cool.)

Cm&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Eb&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Fm&emsp;&emsp;Eb&emsp;&emsp;Cm  
We could try to burn real low, save for our enemies

Gm&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Fm  
All of ourselves, a carnival

Or we could try to hit real hard, throw weight into punches  
Breaking our wrist, a hit or a miss

## Chorus
Bb&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Eb  
Or we could save, we could save ourselves

&emsp;&emsp;Bb&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gm  
We could put our head on a dusty shelf 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ab&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(Bb)&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Cm  
And leave it … until we need its help

## Verse
We could try to wait real long, keeping the sunset  
Onto our backs, our shadows prevail

Or we could try to race headstrong, right from the outset  
Use the surprise as a golden disguise

## Chorus
And you will see, you will see real soon  
There is no plan needed to shoot to the moon  
And we’ll get there ... with our hearts still in tune  
Just hope we’re not immune  

## Solo
Notes:
* Verse chords continue.
* Play something cool. It sounds best to follow the main chord pattern (up -> up -> down | down -> down -> up)

## Verse
Notes:
* Very calm, almost whispery in vocals as well
* Cut verse short, so we immediately transition into chorus on high energy

We could try to shout real loud, if that’s what it takes then  
The clouds won’t dissolve, but mountains of gold

## Chorus
Will await, we will wait my dear  
For that famous sunset to reappear  
It’s never ... never the same  
Just hold me till we’re tamed  

## Outro
Nope, just stop angrily on the last chord
