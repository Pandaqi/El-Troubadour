These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Where the flowers still bloom"

It's track #1 from my album ["Is it Too Much to Ask?"](/albums/is-it-too-much-to-ask)

If you are playing solo, all chords are played with a steady rhythm, mostly muted (with your palm). If you have two guitarists, the second one can strum the actual chords, or do the embellishments you hear on the track.

The song is rather easy to play (no weird chords, mostly repetitive). However, because it goes through a few key changes, it can be very hard to sing (and very easy to forget a key change and play the wrong chords)

## Intro
**A5 -> A5/G#** (2x)

## Verse 1
**Am**  
Come meet me here  
**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C/B**&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
In memories of painted fields

No trace of fear  
The wind, the trees a solid shield

**Bb**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**  
But it’s the past we sow  
**Gm**  
The wind will blow (to)

**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb**  
Where the flowers still bloom  
**A7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**   
Where the flowers still bloom

## Verse 2
The light is strong  
The scent is fresh, the touch is soft

The world it crawls  
Out of its shelter, but it’s robbed

Of any sense at all  
They’re closing in

Where the flowers still bloom  
**A7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D7**  
Where the flowers still bloom

## Chorus 1
**Ebm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B**  
We hold the power  
**Ebm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Db**&emsp;**Bb7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Ebm**  
Beauty in one hand, pain in the other

**Ebm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bbm**  
The world will not remember us  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Db**  
If there’s no life at all to breathe memories _(memorie – ie – ies)_

**Ebm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Db**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B**  
Where the flowers still bloom  
**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb** _(immediate pitch shift half note down)_  
Where the flowers still bloom

**A7**  
Oh _ oh _

(Bb7 -> B7 -> C7 -> Db7 slide up, but muted)

## Verse 3
Come show yourself  
Don’t be afraid, admit the truth

You did not care  
Not in the slightest, now your youth

Is creeping to an end  
You enjoyed your stay

For you, the flowers still bloomed  
For you, the flowers still bloomed

## Verse 4
_(Key change, one semitone higher; pause on Dm is eliminated)_

**Bbm**  
I’d like a day  
**Db**  
When I could open windows wide

**Bbm**  
And smell the air  
**Db**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B**  
Without the risk of dying I

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Ebm**  
Would like some sunshine here  
**Abm**  
To grow the lands

**Ebm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Db**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B**  
Where the flowers don’t bloom  
**Bb7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Db7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Eb7**  
No the flowers don’t bloom

## Chorus  2
_(mostly same as before, just another semitone higher)_

**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
We hold the power  
**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
To fight and fight for a future

**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bm**  
And they, they will remember us  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
As the ones who tore the darkness to shreds

**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
It’s not all doom and gloom  
**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bb**  
Some stubborn flowers will bloom  
**A7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**  
Somewhere those flowers will bloom

## Verse 5
_(softer, mellow, just pluck chords)_

Come meet me there  
Come fill the space where we collide

It’s almost time  
To leave our beating hearts behind

And when we’re done with this  
Planet of ours

Then the flowers will bloom  
Oh the flowers will bloom
