These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "A Thousand Places I Don't Know (Part 2)". It's track #5 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

The only song on the album that's a bit more upbeat and happy, and perhaps needs some more instruments/voices to sound great. 

Also, yeah, it's weird that it has two (maybe three?) outros, but that's the way it is, and what I needed to tell this song's story.

## Chords
Used in bridge:
* **B\*** =   X240XX
* **G\*** = 304000
* **Em\*** = 004000

## Intro
_Same as part 1, but now strummed as chords. Includes both verse and chorus._

## Verse 1
He’s falling on the si __ deline  
He’s telling you to stay and yet you run

So full of disappoin __ tment  
Tell everyone your heart just broke and know

## Chorus 1
Will you stay or will you go?  
To a thousand places you don’t know 

## Verse 2
Take poison, let your health __ drop  
Force thoughts away and live like a machine

Drift away to worlds more hand __ some  
Sleep longer and longer to reach where you have been

## Chorus 2
Will you stay or will you go?  
To a thousand places I can’t show  
Will you stay or will you go?  
To a thousand places I can’t go

## Bridge (repeat)
**B\***&emsp;&emsp;**G\***&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em\***&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G\***  
&emsp;He went down to save his old friend

## Intermezzo
_Going faster and faster, more and more wild, on the chords and pattern of the bridge_

## Verse 3
_Back to melody from part 1. But more shouty, wild, free._

Orpheus don’t look back  
There’s no saving when everyone is lost

Orpheus stop looking back  
Twenty years enslaved, oh they’re long gone

## Verse 4 (different melody; same music)
We’re not going anywhere, we’re not going anywhere  
We’re not going anywhere, we’re not going anywhere  
We’re not going, we’re not going,  
we’re not going anywhere anymore

We will never see it all, we will never see it all  
We will never see it all, we will never see it all  
You can only see me fall, see me fall,  
ever closer to the floor

## Chorus 3
Will you take the pill or no?  
To a thousand places you might love  
Will you keep yourself afloat?  
To a thousand places I don’t 

## Chorus 4 (type B; same as part 1)
**C**&emsp;**C/B**&emsp;**Am**  
Know why he  

**G**&emsp;**D/F#**&emsp;**Em**  
Never went

**C**&emsp;**C/B**&emsp;**Am**  
Was it all fear  

&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;**D/F#** 
Or impairment

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
By the dark he must fight every day

**G**&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C/B**  
That never goes away

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;**C/D**  
Would you care  
From whence it came?

## Outro 1
_Same fast-plucked outro as part 1._

## Outro 2
_Goes to a slow methodical plucking of chords._

&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
It’s a tragedy

**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
&emsp;Can’t change the genre halfway 

Through with this  
&emsp;I cannot live without a

**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
Night in Rome

&emsp;**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
A garden flower-filled and Paris 

**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D/F#**  
Lights they shone so bright

I miss it so  
The summer sun stripes leaving  
Solid gold  
The weight of worlds left safe at  
Home I know  
It’s just some land, should be a better man  
I like to think I am

**Em** _(single strum)_
