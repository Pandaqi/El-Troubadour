These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Always Running". It's track #3 from the album ["Don't Give Me Up"](/albums/dont-give-me-up).

It starts out soft and simple, then builds into a power rock song. (At least, that's the idea, don't know if I succeeded.) 

The key change not only helps with that, it was also added because all the other verses/choruses were just too low for my voice. The falsetto bits in the chorus are equally nice, but optional. 

## Verse I
**Fm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cm**  
That girl, who’s running down the street

**C#**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G#**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G#/G**  
&emsp;They like you, they’ve loved you all along

Those little things, that have you running on your feet  
You’ll pass through, and show the world you have won

**Fm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cm**  
You have friends, you’re not alone

&emsp;&emsp;**C#**&emsp;&emsp;**D#**  
But always _ running _

## Chorus I
**Fm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cm**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is your home

&emsp;&emsp;**C#**&emsp;**D#**  
And all we are

**G#**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Fm**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But not how you’re born

&emsp;&emsp;**C#**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D#**  
Not who you really are

## Verse II
Your world, you've been trying to understand  
It likes you, it sings you showers of praise  

You won’t hear, but that’s why I’ll be standing here  
To tell you, convince your wins will begin

We have faith, we keep saying so  
Yet always running

## Chorus II
This is your home  
And all we are  
But not how you’re born  
Not who you really are

## Bridge
**Fm**                           
Well run away

**Cm**  
To your silent hope

**C#**  
Where they’ll be leaning screaming

**D#**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**(D#/E)**  
Being evil stealing your whole

Chance to run away  
But don’t you dare go  
To that place you’ll face mistakes and race to waste your dying days

**Bbm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bbm**  
&emsp;&emsp;Let us all meet you there to drag you back

_(Musical intermezzo to transition from bridge to last chorus, which is transposed.)_

## Chorus III
**Bbm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Fm**  
&emsp;&emsp;This is your home

&emsp;&emsp;**F#**&emsp;**F7**  
And all we are

**Bbm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C#**  
&emsp;&emsp;But not how you’re born

&emsp;&emsp;**F#**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F7**  
Not who you really are

## Outro
_The melody from the bridge, played as electric guitar solo._
