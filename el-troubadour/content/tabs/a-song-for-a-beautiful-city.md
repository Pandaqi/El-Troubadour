These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "A Song for a Beautiful City". It's track #6 from the album ["Don't Forget Me"](/albums/dont-forget-me).

This song has very much a "lovely night in Paris" vibe to it. It also uses many weird chords that you normally won't find together. The hardest part is singing the right notes over them without "reaching" for them.

It's also a waltz. (So 3/4 or 6/8 time, however you like to look at it.)

## Verse 1
**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bdim**  
&emsp;In the lights of the city

**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Gm**  
&emsp;I drew up the stars just for you

**Dm**  
&emsp;Seen through the lenses of

**Ddim**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Millions of people, they met her

**E7**  
It is such a pity

**Am**  
That we can’t be together

## Verse 2
In the lights of the city  
I showed you the way to the heart  
Seen through the glasses of  
Millions of buildings, they get her  
It is such a pity  
That we can’t be together  

## Chorus
&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**  
But baaaabyyy

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
Tonight you look so bella

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
Tonight you’d steal the thunder from the sun

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Ddim**&emsp;&emsp;**Cm**  
And we’ve only just begun we’re

**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E7**  
Dancing ‘till its dawn

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**  
Because I want you

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
Baby I still need you

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Fmaj7**  
To redirect my life

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bbsus2**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bdim**  
It lacks fire and true desire

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
When we can’t be together

## Verse 3
In the lights of the city  
I let go all fears just for you  
And through the masses  
Of interesting people, I let her  
It’s just such a pity  
That we can’t stay together

## Verse 4
In the lights of the city  
I ran down my youth just for fun  
And through the rainstorms  
The cold nights and moonlights, I weather  
It was such a pity  
That we were not together

## Chorus 2
Because baby __  
Tonight you look so bella  
Tonight you’d steal the fire from the stars  
And we’ve only just begun to  
Find which part is ours  

Because I want you  
Baby I still need you  
To redirect my soul  
It’s not whole, it’s on hold  
When we are not together

## Solo
**C**&emsp;**Am**&emsp;**F**
_(play that piano line over it)_

## Chorus 3
Because baby __  
Tonight you look so bella  
Tonight you’d rob the water of its flow  
And we’ve only just begun to  
Really get to know  

That I want you  
Baby I still need you  
To redirect my mind  
It needs air, neon pairs,  
Cause we are not together  

## Outro
_Same as solo, but now with a “la la la” or “na na na” over it_
