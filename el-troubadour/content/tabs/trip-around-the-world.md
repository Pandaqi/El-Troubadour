These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Trip Around the World". It's track #5 from the album ["Don't Forget Me"](/albums/dont-forget-me).

The "rock song" of this album. A relatively simple and short one, especially because it doesn't have a bridge and instead uses an electric guitar solo.

That's also why the chords are quite basic. I like to start by playing them the normal way, but during the song I transition to playing the "power chord" version of them.

## Verse 1
**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
&emsp;I wish you luck on your trip around the world

&emsp;&emsp;**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
I wish time would let you fly by

&emsp;&emsp;**Em**&emsp;**C/B**&emsp;**Am**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F**&emsp;  
It’s all for nothing girl

**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
&emsp;I wish you strength on your walk to sacred grounds

&emsp;&emsp;**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
I wish time would hand you insight

&emsp;**Em**&emsp;&emsp;**C/B**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
It’s not for most and it’s certainly not fair

## Chorus 1
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cadd9**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
Sometimes the good time’s falling apart

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cadd9** _(High E-string transition)_  
Sometimes we can’t escape from this rollercoaster

**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
Ride __ I’m falling behind

**C**  
Need more time

**D**  
Running through our mind __

## Post-Chorus 1
**Em**&emsp;**G**&emsp;**Em**

## Verse 2
I wish you love from the people there above  
I wish you would come home safely  
Or it’s all for nothing girl  

I wish you speed on your course around the stone  
I wish I had known your freedom  
But it’s fear I know, and never lets me go

## Chorus 2
Sometimes the good girls run in our head  
Sometimes the light we gave, is the light we never  
Had __ 	I’m wasting my life  
In my mind  
I must have called a thousand times _  

## Post-Chorus 2
**Em**&emsp;**G**&emsp;**Em**  
**D**&emsp;**C**&emsp;**D**

## Solo 
_(repeat a few times, play something cool over it)_  
**Em**&emsp;**G**&emsp;**C**&emsp;**B7**

**C** -> **C/B** -> **C/A** -> **C/G**   
**D** _(for transition to last chorus)_

## Chorus 3
Sometimes the far lands run through our heads  
Sometimes we can’t escape to a life we cannot  
Have __ 	I’m stuck in the grind  
Need more time  
Repeating that same line __  

## Post-Chorus
**Em**&emsp;**G**&emsp;**C**&emsp;**Am**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Time and time and time  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That line that line that line  

**Em** _(hard end on this)_
