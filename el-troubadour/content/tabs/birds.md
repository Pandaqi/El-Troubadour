These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Birds". It's track #2 from the album ["Don't Give Me Up"](/albums/dont-give-me-up). 

A very short and simple song, accompanied by plucking two (or three) strings, not even full chords.

## Intro (guitar picking)
D | 5 - | 4 - | 7 - | 9 - |  
G | - 0 | - 0 | - 0 | - 0 |

## Verse I
_(Same guitar picking as intro)_  
Take the shadows or we’ll live in vain  
Pick up the leaves and take one last bow  
Homeless hearts could not foresee this pain  
Countless stars that could be ours

Look at me I’m your mirror bright  
A million birds that sang their song  
Talk no more or it will start a fight  
But for both is what they sung

## Chorus I
D* = XX4030  
C* = XX5030

&emsp;&emsp;**D\***&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C\***  
And one day we’ll grow old  
Thinking had I talked – or changed  

## Verse II
Know your weakness but don’t start alone  
In the forest you’ll always live  
Your trembling hands will not be held by some  
Birds that could throw you off the cliff

## Chorus II
And while then we’re still young  
Stand still where you lie down – to think about life

## Outro
D | 9 - - - | 7 – - | 5 - - | 4 - - | 2 - - |
