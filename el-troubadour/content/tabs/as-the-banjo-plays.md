These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "As the Banjo Plays". It's track #7, or the _bonus track_, from the album ["Don't Forget Me"](/albums/dont-forget-me).

Obviously, if you can play it on a banjo, that's great. The melody was created from just walking up/down the lowest string (in the verse) and the highest string (in the chorus, playing the right chords on the banjo).

I wrote it on a 5-stringed banjo, of which the lower strings are the same as the 4 lower strings on the guitar. Except for the highest one; it's offset by two. This means the song can be played just as well on guitar.

## Verse 1
&emsp;&emsp;**Em**&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
I remember now

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
The day you bought your instruments

&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
I recall you finally

**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
&emsp;Opening up &emsp;_(pronounce opening as two syllables)_

&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Your heart

## Verse 2
If you can’t tell me  
I’ve no place in your mute life  
All your soothing  
Melodies still enjoyed  
In spite

## Chorus 1
&emsp;&emsp;**Em7**&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
Saying he will sail

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Safe into the night

**Em7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
He will be there

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cadd9**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
When you’re giving up on life

**G**  
And he’ll come singing  
And he’ll come singing  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D/F#**  
‘Till you sleep

## Verse 3
(And) as the banjo plays  
Our kids a million miles away  
Will they know  
That these pained words  
Would become your last  

## Chorus 2
Saying he will sing  
Late into the night  

He’ll say the words  
When you’re done and filled with hurt  

Oh he will change then  
He will transform like  
A songbird

## Bridge
_This is kind of the “reverse” of the verse melody_

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
And as the banjo broke

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
His songs stuttered and he choked

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
He was never what you dreamt

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B7**  
But you loved

## Chorus 3
Him with all  
Your heart he kept in tune  

He’ll clear the air  
From despair because he cares  

And he’ll keep asking  
Oh he’ll keep asking  
Until you say  
Alright

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
You can hold me tight
