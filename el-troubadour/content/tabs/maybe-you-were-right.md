These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Maybe you were right". It's track #2 from the album ["Feast your Eyes on Me"](/albums/feast-your-eyes-on-me). 

One of my (rare) upbeat, uptempo, loose songs. So don't get too hung up on precise timings, and feel free to improvise around the chords if you feel like it.

As such, the chords aren't that special or unique, nor set in stone. Still, for completeness:
* D7 = XX0212
* B7 = X21202
* C\* = X30005
* G\* = 300005

**Remark**: The verses are slightly faster than the chorus. Which is ... unusual, but fits this song and its theme, that's why. (It's usually the other way around.)

**Remark**: We’re actually in the key of G Major, not C major, even though it may seem so.

## Verse 1
**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
&emsp;&emsp;They say the beauty’s in the pause

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
The memory shines when it’s lost

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Guess I will never forget

## Verse 2
They say you cannot force a spark  
The light’s much brighter in dark  
But I have to close my eyes

## Pre-Chorus 1
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
So you see it’s all a mess

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D7**  
I’ll just work with what I have

## Chorus 1
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
And I believe that there’s a place 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
where it will find me and I’ll do it all

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**  
But you believed that I’m just running, fleeing, 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
with my back against the wall

&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
But I will conquer countries, 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
sail my ship to worlds unknown

&emsp;**D**  
Or you will hear me saying, 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C\***&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G\***&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
maybe you were riiiiiiiight ___ 

## Verse 3
You say I have to slow it down  
I’m just met with a frown _(half tempo)_  
With this time and space I drown

## Verse 4
You say, some silence would be nice  
_(no lyrics/silence for one bar)_  
Guess your wish comes at a price

## Pre-Chorus 2
**B7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B7**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It’s a bitter realization

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
That my age is not my skill

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Em**  
Still don’t know my occupation

&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
But I guess I never will

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D7**  
I never will

## Chorus 2
Feel like my work is done my mind  
can rest now I am satisfied

You feel my body’s drained, the age old test  
is will I make it to the night

But hey I made some things,  
I made a thing out of thin air

And now I make excuses,  
‘cause maybe you were riiiiight __

Maybe in my mind  
Things are not as fine  
Maybe you were right

## Solo

## Verse 5
But if I may be so bold  
I guess to have and to hold   
Means to live under sun

## Pre-Chorus
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am**  
With your arms outstretched

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D7**  
Only thoughts of you in my head

## Chorus
_(optional key change: one semitone higher)_  
But first I’ll have to find you,  
get you, keep you, never let you go

My world so far was numbers, papers,  
and a future growing cold

I guess I could make space,  
for a few days, for better ways

And when we greet the night,  
I’ll say maybe you were riiiiight ___

Maybe we have time  
Maybe I need a guide  
Maybe you were right

## Outro
IMPROVISE. (Or just do the solo again.)
