These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Careful Not to Dream (Part 2)". It's track #7 from the album ["Until It's Over"](/albums/until-its-over).

I want to say this song is more hopeful and soothing. It pretends to be, though. It has some more upbeat melodies among it, generally a more soothing vibe, and the chorus literally says "there's nothing to fear for". But I think the first and last lyrics of the song demonstrate the feeling from which to play it.

## Verse 1
**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_(Dsus2 -> Dsus4 -> D)_  
Baby give me Armageddon

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dsus2**  
All I had is gone

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D/C**  
As I move on

**F#7**  
&emsp;To a place we both know

**Bm**  
&emsp;Baby don’t leave me hanging

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
Cause I am hanging on

## Chorus 1
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
Now there’s nothing to fear for

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;**A**&emsp;&emsp;**Bm**  
There’s nothing to __ fear

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E**  
As I’m waiting here in sunlight and soft beds 

&emsp;&emsp;**F#7**  
I’m keeping faith in the

**B7**  
&emsp;Way mistakes make you

**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
Grow&emsp;&emsp;and soon all will know __

## Verse 2
Baby listen to my words now  
All the hurt goes down  
When you’re around  
You need not make a sound   
Baby I will come running  
To see your stunning frown

## Chorus 2
And there’s nothing to fear for  
There’s nothing to __ fear  
We are late to the party but we’re here  
I’m keeping faith in the  
Way dreams give you a  
Strength to rise each day again __  

## Bridge (same as bridge of part 1)
**Bm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cmaj7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Gsus2**  
&emsp;&emsp;But what if I end up succeeding

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E**  
Despite all the odds

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C#m**&emsp;&emsp;**B**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
Was it worth the time wasted in bed

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cmaj7**  
Are you looking for impressive feats?

&emsp;**Dmaj7**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Cmaj7**  
Or just a boy who keeps his dreams  

&emsp;&emsp;**Gsus2**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E**  
Like jewels proudly on display  

&emsp;&emsp;**C#m**&emsp;&emsp;**B**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
But never so foolish to chase them down  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Asus2/F#**  
What is truly wise and sound  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am/E**  
What you ask is … 

**D/F#** 
_(transitional chord; can do without it, but hard to pinpoint the vocal starting note that way)_

## Chorus 3 (softer, more like a lullaby)
Make there nothing to fear for  
Nothing to __ fear  
Make us safe, warm and fed, make us play __  
Please keep our faith in the  
Way a life will turn   
Out what you put in __

## Outro
_The main melody from part 1 again. But just once or twice, really soft/sad/distant. And, well, like an outro._

**Bm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
Anything I own  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
Left it on the stones

Careful not to dream  
The lies still make you gleam

Anything I own  
Built from the unknown

Careful not to dream  
It’s real, so it might seem

**F#7**  
(These days)

**Bm** _(randomly arpeggiated)_
