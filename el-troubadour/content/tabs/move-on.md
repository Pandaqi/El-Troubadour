These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Move on"

It's track #4 from my album ["Is it Too Much to Ask?"](/albums/is-it-too-much-to-ask)

From time to time, I allow myself to base a song off the default "4 chord pop song": most of this song is just the chords C -> G -> Am -> F. 

To make it more varied and interesting, some weird chords are thrown in here and there. Whenever I play these, I actually play two variations after each other (only changing the fingering on the highest E-string). That's what the "->" means in the chord list below.

Also, a key change happens during the bridge. (And another key change back for the last part of the song.)

Chords:
* Gm\* = 333335 (-> 333333)
* Am\* = 555558 (-> 555555)
* F\* = 111113 (-> 111111)

## Verse 1
**C&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;G**  
I would skip class, just to watch you walk me by  
**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Am&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;F**  
Because I like to see you move on, and I have to get my move on  

**C&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gm\***  
I like to wonder, what it means to live  
**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Am&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;F**  
With a chip upon your shoulder, when my life’s moving so slowly  
**&emsp;&emsp;G7**  
At times

## Chorus 1
**Dm&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Am	E7&emsp;&emsp;Am**  
&emsp;&emsp;Wake me up, when it ends  
**Dm&emsp;E7&emsp;F&emsp;G&emsp;Am**  
Tell me once again

**Am\***  
&emsp;&emsp;I’m going somewhere  
**F\*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;E7**  
&emsp;&emsp;I’ll one day get there

## Verse 2
I would hang around, many hours after hours  
‘Cause I like to see you move on, makes me headstrong, brings me undone  

And as you vanished, into the sunset bright  
I would reminisce a future, we could live together,  
Sometime  

## Chorus 2
Just wake me up, when it ends  
Tell me once again  
I’m going somewhere  
I’ll one day get there  

## Bridge
**Gm\***  
But for the moment  
**F#7**  
I’ll wait, I wait, I have to wait  

**Bm&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;G**  
We all have, a path, a plan, a winding road  
**Bm&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;G**  
We all bring, a pen, a paper back to bed

**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;D&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;D/C#**  
But we must move, move out of that daydream  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
The only way forward  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F#7**  
Is to break the chains and take the step

**E7**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And you could help with that

## Intermezzo
**C&emsp;&emsp;G&emsp;&emsp;Am&emsp;&emsp;F**

## Verse 3
I’d stay up all night, just to find the perfect words  
‘Cause I like to see you move on, you don’t have to take me with you  

Even sleepless, burned-out, I can appreciate  
The wonders from behind, when my life’s moving so quickly  
At times

## Chorus 3
Wake me up, let it end  
Show me once again  
We’re going somewhere  
We’ll one day get there  

## Outro
**E7&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;C**  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;All in good time
