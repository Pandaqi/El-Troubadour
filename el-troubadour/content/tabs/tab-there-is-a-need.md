This is the official tab for my song "There Is a Need".

This is track #3 on the album ["Keeping the Sunset on my Side"](/albums/keeping-the-sunset-on-my-side/).

On the recording, there are actually two guitars: the main chords and embellishments on top with a second recording. I do this very often, because playing "just" chords creates a distinct lack of variation and high frequencies in a song. The embellishments are simply playing notes from the same scale, but only on the higher strings (and higher frets) of the guitar.

Some remarks:
* This song is actually in 6/8 time, not the very common 4/4 time.
* In the chorus, I move up the guitar for the D and Em chord. (So I play X57775 and X79987, instead of the default chords.) 
* Why? Because then the chords follow the voice, and it provides a nice contrast to the later part of the chorus, in which I move down and DO play a low Em chord.



## Intro
D – G – A – Bm – Bm – A – G – F#7

## Verse
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;D&emsp;G&emsp;A&emsp;D  
So let us run, before it all depletes

&emsp;&emsp;G&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Bm  
The mountain still loves me

&emsp;&emsp;Bm&emsp;&emsp;A&emsp;&emsp;G  
And I can’t tell you how

So let us climb, to rise above the sound  
Jails I may not haunt  
But I can’t show you how  

F#7

## Chorus
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Bm&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;D  
There is a mind, there is a line

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Em&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Bm  
There is a space we left behind

&emsp;A&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;G&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;D/F#  
And I can’t tell, I can’t tell  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Em&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;F#7  
If we’re blind __

There is a need, there are the free  
We have agreed to not believe  
Those that talk, oh they can talk  
‘Till they see  

## Verse
Oh let us blame, the emptiness on God  
The future may not hold  
The brightness we assume  

And let us name, the ones that made us weep  
Destroyed the peace we seek  
Those words will surely heal  

## Chorus
We have a mind, we have a life  
We have a space we’ll leave behind  
But they will fight, they will fight  
‘Till they’re blind  

We have our needs, we would be free  
If those forsaken brainless would just kneel  
For the powers, beyond our grasp  
We can’t see  

## Solo
Play the chords from the chorus, improvise something cool on top :)

## Bridge
**Remark!** Pluck and pick the chords, instead of strumming. Also, soft singing, more like melodious talking.

I don’t ask for much  
I just ask for food and shelter  
A warmth, a goal, that will never  
Waiver under storms  

And I don’t ask too much  
A small space to call home  
Those big machines and drones  
Won’t do me any good  

## Chorus
Cause I have my mind, I have my lines  
I need a space I cannot find  
And I can’t tell, I can’t tell  
Why it’s gone  

I have a need, rather be free  
Forcing our children into these  
Systems too big, hearts way too small  
They don’t belong  

## Outro
Play the chords from the chorus, but with a different rhythm (hard slam, then mute/pause), and alternate between an open A-string and the actual note.
