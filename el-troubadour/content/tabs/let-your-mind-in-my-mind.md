These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "Let Your Mind in My Mind". It's track #4 from the album ["Don't Forget Me"](/albums/dont-forget-me).

Don't have much notes on this song. Chords are quite simple, nothing fancy going on here. This song has some qualities of a "musical theatre" song, especially the intermezzo and bridge. Best played with a healthy dose of frustration and cynicism, though not too much.

## Verse 1
**Bm**  
It went over my head

**D**  
All the things we don’t talk about

**Bm**  
Training liars instead

**D**  
Put the food in and shut your mouth

**G**  
My my, my my

**F#7**  
What a time, a time

## Intermezzo (2x)
**Em**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**B7**   
Hear me, hear me, hear me

## Verse 2
It went over our heads  
All the things we won’t talk about  
Keep the dreams for our beds  
Speak your mind but don’t speak it loud  
My my, my my  
Are we fine, we fine  

## Chorus 1
&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
I don’t need you to explain this

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dsus4**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**  
I’m not stupid, I’m just young

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bm**  
When you change my time in your time

&emsp;**A**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**E**  
I choke on all this love

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
I could not spend __

**Am**&emsp;**D/F#**&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**(A)**  
_(draw out last syllable)_

## Verse 3
My time like I should  
All the things we can’t talk about  
Trading diamonds for naught  
Teaching things we can do without  
My my, my my  
What a lie, a lie  

## Chorus 2
I don’t need you to be perfect  
My heart is big enough  
When you push your life in my life  
It’s all for which I fought  
So let it in __  

**Am**&emsp;**D/F#**&emsp;**G**  
**Am**&emsp;**Bb**&emsp;&emsp;**C**

## Transition
**D**  
&emsp;If you scream and no one’s around

**D/C#**  
&emsp;No identity hearing those sounds

**D**  
&emsp;What use is the perfect life well-spent

**E**  
&emsp;Without an unexpected hand __

## Bridge
**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**  
I’ve slept in soft beds, since I was young

**A**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D**&emsp;&emsp;**D/C#**  
I’ve lived in freedom, or so I’ve been told __

**Bm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F#7**  
Entertainment to spare, blankets and a teddy bear

**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Bm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
More food than I can swallow, people too many to know

**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**F#7**  
But it’s not the same, it’s really not the same

&emsp;&emsp;**Bm**  
As a mind unique as yours,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
Breaking the ceiling raising floors

&emsp;&emsp;**D**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**D/C#**&emsp;**Bm**  
To do as you like, but close to me

&emsp;&emsp;**A**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
To make up your mind and make me see __

## Chorus 3
I don’t need you to remind me  
My dreams are big enough  
When you let your mind in my mind  
It sings a brand-new song  
I did not write __  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**A**  
And that’s what I like

## Intermezzo (2x)
So hear me, hear me, hear me

## Outro
_Pluck verse melody on guitar_.
