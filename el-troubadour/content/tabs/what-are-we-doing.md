These are the official lyrics and chords for the song "What are we doing?"

It's track #2 from my album ["Is it Too Much to Ask?"](/albums/is-it-too-much-to-ask)

The song basically has two sections that alternate: the start section with plucked guitar (in the key of Bb) and the other one with chord strumming (in the key of E). Despite the key difference, the melody itself (mostly) stays the same.

The plucked section has some odd chords (which I'll outline below), the other uses more standard chords.

Chords:
* Bb6 = X1303X
* F* = (1)0321X
* Gm* = 333336
* Am* = 555568

## Verse 1
**Bb6**&emsp;**F\***  
Little baby,  
**Bb6**&emsp;**F\***   
Kneels before me  

**Bb6**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Gm\***&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Am\***  
What are we doing, when all is said and done  
**Gm\***&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Dm**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**(Ebdim)**  
	What have I become?

## Chorus 1
&emsp;**E**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Asus2**  
I wa __ nt this to go __ on  
There’s no __ need to play __ on

**C#m**&emsp;&emsp;**(G#m)**&emsp;**F#m**  
Maybe if I sleep it off  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G#m**  
We will begin again, like we are just friends  
&emsp;**Asus2**  
And no one else will understand that  

## Verse 2
**C#m**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G#m**  
Flesh and bone kneels  
**C#m**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**G#m**   
Stares at light beams  

**C#m** **(Bsus2)** **Asus2**		&emsp;**G#m**  
What are we doing	&emsp;&emsp;		separated now  
**F#m**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**C#m**&emsp;&emsp;**E/D#**  
So far from what we loved

## Chorus 2
I wa __ nt this to change __ now  
But I __ m stuck in these ways __ now

**A7** _(this chorus is cut short)_

## Verse 3 (same as verse 1)
Little baby  
Kneels before me  
Asks a question _(extra line, first note one higher)_  

Why do we make this so hard on ourselves  
That we repel our other half

## Chorus 3
It’s just a si __ mple question  
And the an __ swer oh so clear  

When we’ve all turned to dust

What will you desire  
What will you regret  
If I’d gifted some time  
And worked a little less  
If I

## Verse 4 (same as verse 2)
Had a moment  
To answer questions  

What are we doing?  
What are we doing?  
What are we doing?  
What are we doing?  

## Chorus 4
(doiiiiiing) ____  
(doiiiiiing) ____ here

## Solo
**C#m**&emsp;&emsp;**G#m**  
**C#m**&emsp;&emsp;**G#m**  
**C#m**&emsp;**(B)**&emsp;**Asus2**  
**G#m\***&emsp;&emsp;**F#m\***  
**E**  
**C#m -> B -> Asus2**  
**C#m -> B -> A7**  

Of course, this is the background guitar. An actual solo is played on top.

## Outro (same as verse 1)
Little baby  
Kneels before me  

And I am certain  
It’s all I wanted

It’s all I ever  
Ever really wanted

It’s all I ever  
Ever needed

_(fade out slowly on first pattern)_
